"This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that \
uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server \
or client. IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one \
needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application: \
multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and \
SSL version selection. As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with \
mod_perl."

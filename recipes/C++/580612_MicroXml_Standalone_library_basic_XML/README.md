MicroXml provides stand-alone support for the basic, most-used features of XML -- tags, attributes, and element values. It produces a DOM tree of XML nodes. MicroXml does not support DTDs, CDATAs and other advanced XML features.

MicroXml is easy to use and provides easy access to view/navigate its nodes in a debugger.

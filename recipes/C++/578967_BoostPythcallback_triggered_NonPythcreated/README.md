Consider  we have virtual/abstract C++ class that's fully implemented in Python. And for some sake of necessity we have a callback method (e.g. as some sort of event) that is being triggered from different thread on C++ side.
In such case corresponding callback methods have to manage GIL state via PyGILState_STATE.
So the resulting C++ callback class definition will look like follows (notice that Python method calls are wrapped up with GIL state handling code).

Add function to __builtin__ module through C API

Sometimes it need to embedding a Python script to a C code, and it references to a function, which also provided by the same C code. Then you have to import the module, as you defined in your C code.

But this import would be skipped, if you add your function to your __builtin__ module. In Python3 (3.5), there is the PyModule_AddFunctions() function, but in the previous versions, you can make it like this snippet.

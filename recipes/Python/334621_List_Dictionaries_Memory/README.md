I often return result sets from a database call using a list of dictionary objects. When transmitting the pickled list object over the wire, the size of the pickle greatly effects the speed of the transmission.

I wrote this small class to emulate a list of dictionary objects without the memory and pickle storage overhead which occurs when storing every item in the list as a dictionary.

This recipe implements a design pattern useful for performing an object-oriented case analysis for a particular object (or a collection of objects as well). Essentially, it is an alternative to complex if-then-else or switches. Modelling each case with a particular class, the Concrete Class Finder searches for an appropriate case/class that applies to the given object/s. Once found, this class can be used in an homogeneous way, independently of the object/s previously considered.

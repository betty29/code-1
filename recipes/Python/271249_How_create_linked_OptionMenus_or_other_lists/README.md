This recipe shows how to create linked OptionMenus in Tkinter. That is, how to ensure that when you select an item in the first list, the list contents change in the second list, which changes the contents in the third list.  While this code is for Pmw OptionMenus, it should be easily adaptable to other types of picklist or radiobutton widgets.

This recipe shows how to process a text file in order to create an index of the words in it. The index created is a separate text file, and consists of one entry (which is one line) per unique word in the file. The first item in the line is the word itself, and the subsequent items are the line numbers on which that word occurs in the text file being processed. The words and line numbers are separated by spaces.

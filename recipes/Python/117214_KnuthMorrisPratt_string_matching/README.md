This is an implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding copies of a given pattern as a contiguous subsequence of a larger text.  Since KMP accesses the text only sequentially, it is natural to implement it in a way that allows the text to be an arbitrary iterator.  After a preprocessing stage which takes time linear in the length of the pattern, each text symbol is processed in constant amortized time.

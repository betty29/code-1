The following two programs are simple examples of how one might go about creating a password generator. The first one was created several years ago and was designed to return passwords where similarly classed characters would not appear beside each other. It works but gets unbearably slow when passwords exceed about forty characters. The second program was designed with similar requirements runs considerably better. Eight-character passwords appear to have the same randomness to their construction, and this program is considerably faster than the first. Hopefully, these program design differences will be helpful to others trying to write their own password generator.

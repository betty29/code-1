This code is a derivative of the Pure Sinewave Generator and produces a continuous noise out of the speakers or headphone sockets.

It is for the hobbyist to be able to generate a pseudo-random noise signal for testing with.

It is issued as Public Domian and you may do with it as you please.

It is very easy to convert to Python 3.x.x but as OSX only has 2.7.x and lower ATM then these are what are used...

An installation of pyaudio IS needed for this to work; see the code for more information.

It is near platform independent but sadly the AMIGA is not included, but hey, I have already shown how generate sound for Classic AMIGAs.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

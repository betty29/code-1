This is a recipe for a Python "data object." It is similar in function to namedtuple (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/500261/) and recordtype (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576555-records/) in that it is a simple container for data, but is designed to meet three specific goals:
1. Easy to subclass data objects.
2. Get/set speed comparable to a simple class.
3. Minimal memory consumption per instance.

Hi experts...

I think that this is a first... ;o)

Another kids level project to do for yourselves...

This is yet another Python DEMO to show the power of the sound card using
Linux as an audio frequency counter.

It is a kids level project that uses the sound card as an input through the
microphone socket to measure up to >3500Hz from a symmetrical waveform, sine
square or triangle. See the comments inside the code for more details...

The only external hardware required is a test lead; oh my, this is technical
stuff... ;o)

This is for Python 2.x.x, (probably even down to 1.5.2) but it would be
just as easy to make it work on 3.x.x. I've already done it......

......But I'll let the big guns do that for you...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...

Be aware of word wrapping etc...

Bazza,  G0LCU...

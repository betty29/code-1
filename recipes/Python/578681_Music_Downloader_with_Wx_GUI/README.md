Just type in a song and the artist and the program will get the YouTube video, convert it to an mp3 then download it!
It has a high quality function and a medium quality function and also the user can choose the directory and name they want the file to be saved to!

It is the first time I've used threads and my second time with WxPython! I used BeautifulSoup for the scraping and I'm pretty familiar with that.just thought id share it with you guys and see if you have any feedback or suggestions!

also you may get an error saying self.convhtml doesn't exist just wait then retry

Here is a link to an screenshot:

if you want you can checkout the Github page:

also you will need to make a folder called Files and put a file called dir.txt and in the file write /Files. this is where the music will be downloaded to!

I just made the .exe so you can just use that and its easier!

A very simple module to extend the original rlcompleter module in standard library.
After invoke python interpreter and import irlcompleter,
you can indent and also complete valid python identifiers and keywords using a single "tab" key!

Note1: original python rlcompleter module only avail in unix-like environment
Note2: if you seek a completer with history viewer support and more features you could try Sunjoong LEE's recipe at: http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/496822

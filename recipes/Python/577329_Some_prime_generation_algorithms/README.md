Basic idea was to see the difference between different prime algorithms in time. Also they are not perfect the output shows that really higher numbers let grow the difference why I have separated this into functions to make it visible. I add this here because I have been missing this very often when I have been searching for algorithms.

 * The 'is_prime' is a well known way of checkin for a number being prime or not.
 * The sieve of Erastothenes is simply to strike out multiples of a given value; the primes will remain.
 * the function 'profile' is a decorator for functions measuring the execution time
 * Some information are in the comments of the code

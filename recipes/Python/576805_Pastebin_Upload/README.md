A little script I made for some buddies and I. We are constantly collaborating on code. This scrips takes a source code file as it's parameter and uploads it to pastebin.com or any sub domain of pastebin.
I integrated it with the righ click window in windows. Without that integration the script wouldn't be as cool!
Hope others find it useful.

This code shows how to open up a default Terminal running Python to tha maximum allowed on the _desktop_. I decided on writing code to do a crude emulation of a Campimeter. Anyone who has worn spectacles for a long time has had this test done at the optician's. Originally written for a Macbook Pro, OSX 10.7.5 but also tested on Debian Linux 6.0.x. READ the code for more information!!! This code WILL alter the size of the Terminal window AND changes the colours too, although it is very easy to return back to the default state it is NOT included in the code... I EXPECT professionals to know how to doo that.

Before running Python inside the Terminal ensure the Terminal window is at the uppermost left hand corner of your desktop...

I needed the maximised Python Terminal for something else but this was the easiest way to demonstrate ho to do it through Python...

Written so that kids can understand what is going on...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

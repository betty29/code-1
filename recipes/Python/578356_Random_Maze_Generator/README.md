Random maze generator using depth-first search.

It starts the maze path from a random cell and there is no exit defined but actually any 2 cells on the path (white cells) can be assigned to be entry and exit locations. (I could just add code to randomly select 2 white cells and change their colors to something else but I thought it looks better this way.)

The following class implements a reader-writer lock to use in the second readers-writers problem with python threads. In this problem, many readers can simultaneously access a share, and a writer has an exclusive access to this share. Additionally, the following constraints should be met: 1) no reader should be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading unless a writer is also waiting for the share, 2) no writer should be kept waiting for the share longer than absolutely necessary.

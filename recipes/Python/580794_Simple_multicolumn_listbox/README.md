This recipe makes easy to work a treeview widget like a table.

It has several options for styling:

- heading_anchor
- heading_font
- heading_background
- heading_foreground
- cell_anchor
- cell_background
- cell_foreground
- cell_font
- cell_pady
- height
- padding
- adjust_heading_to_content
- stripped_rows
- headers
- selection_background
- selection_foreground
- field_background

The "command" parameter is a callback and its called each time a row is selected.

If you have the freedom to choose your abscissas and your integrand is smooth or has
a log singularity, then this script is for you. It computes the definite integral of a user
defined function over the interval [a, b]. The user can specify the number of Gauss
points (1 <= ng <= 12), the default being ng=10.

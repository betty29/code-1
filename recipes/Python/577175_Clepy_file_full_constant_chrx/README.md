This script identifies every chr(xx) call in a script (being xx an integer) and replaces it with a constant byte string. For example: print chr(13) + chr(255) in the input .py file gets translated into '\n' + '\xff' on the output .py file, not breaking the input program, and maybe speeding it a little.

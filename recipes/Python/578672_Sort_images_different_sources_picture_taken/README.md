On some occasions/events, pictures will be taken by different camera's, mobile phones, etc. In order to sort these photos chronologically, it does not suffice using the file's date modified/created set by the OS. The following script obtains, from multiple sources, the pictures' taken date stored in the accompanying Exif data and outputs them all chronologically in a single directory.

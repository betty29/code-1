Two linear-time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.  `strongly_connected_components_tree` implements (a variant of) Tarjan's well-known algorithm for finding strongly connected components, while `strongly_connected_components_path` implements a path-based algorithm due (in this form) to Gabow.

Edit:  I added an iterative function `strongly_connected_components_iterative`;  this is a direct conversion of `strongly_connected_components_path` into iterative form.  It's therefore safe to use on high-depth graphs, without risk of running into Python's recursion limit.

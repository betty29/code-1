User friendly template class targeted towards Web-page usage and optimized for speed and efficiency.

Tags can be inserted in a template HTML file in a non-intrusive way, by using specially formatted comment strings. Therefore, the template-file can be viewed in a browser, even with prototype data embedded in it, which will later be replaced by dynamic content.
Also, webdesigners can continue to work on the template and upload it without further 
modification.

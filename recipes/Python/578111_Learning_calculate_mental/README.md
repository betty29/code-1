**What is it about?**
 * Learning to use the basic math operation (+, -, *,/).
 * Print out of statistics to show you where you are.
 * Being able to define your own training sessions.
 * Sessions with number of tasks or with a time limit.

**What has changed?**

 * Revision 2: Contains now the **tasks numbering**.
 * Revision 2: You can see overall how long you didn't a training.
 * Revision 2: You also can see per kind of session how long you didn't a training.
 * Revision 3: **Trainings parameter as kind of policy** in a separate class also used as key for statistic.
 * Revision 3: **New session type**: timeout (as many tasks as possible until timeout exceeded)
 * Revision 3: I'm also sorry to say that this revision breaks compatibility with previously stored sessions.
 * Revision 4: **Integer division** supported.

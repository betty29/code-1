This program takes input from the user and determines the amount of gardening materials needed for a garden. The garden is a perfect square. The four outer flowerbeds are congruent semicircles and the central flowerbed is a perfect circle. Everything else inside the garden is considered fill: stone, mulch, or other fill material.

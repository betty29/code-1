This is the Python API for my arduino uno board.
this is base on what i posted in [Part I](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577520-csc-prototype-to-arduino-board-with-python-api-par/?in=user-163970) ..
I didn't spend time to comments it...
I'll do it once free soon.
Please study it and extend it and share among open source members especially in python... :)

The file name is "cscarduino.py"

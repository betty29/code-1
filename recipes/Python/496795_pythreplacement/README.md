This recipe provides a quick and easy way to process Java properties files using pure Python. Of course, Jython can always be used, but in situations where Jython cannot be used, this recipe provides a sure-fire drop-in replacement. The Properties class is modelled to duplicate the behaviour of the original as closely as possible.

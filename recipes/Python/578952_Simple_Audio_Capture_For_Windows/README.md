This snippet will capture from approximately 1 second to nearly 10000 hours of audio silently using Windows SoundRecorder.exe and save automatically to a file named SAMPLE.WAV in the C:\Windows\Temp\ folder/drawer/directory. It is 16 bit signed integer depth, stereo and sampled at 44100 Hz.
This is for Python 2.0.1 to 3.3.2, (my latest version).

Enjoy finding simple solutions to very difficult problems...

(An OSX version is on its way too...)

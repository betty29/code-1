reads bash.org/latest and saves it to a pre made .html file. on mac OSX i made a simple automater program that runs python BashReader.py in the terminal and set it to run when i login. evry time it runs it overwrites the old file so you don't have to worry about hundreds of bash.htmls mounting up on your computer

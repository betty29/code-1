If you have a function that calls another, passing through an argument, you likely want the default argument of your function to match that of the called function.

Deferred default arguments is what I call the technique of using a sentinel for the default argument of your function and having the called function translate the sentinel into its own default argument.

You'll find a more thorough treatment after the recipe.

The following function will scramble a string, preserving spaces that separate the words, and return the result. I used this for a word game that scrambled words and phrases, which a player then attempted to descramble. For example, scrambling the following string: "teenage mutant ninja turtles" would return "etegnae tamtnu jnnai urtltes"

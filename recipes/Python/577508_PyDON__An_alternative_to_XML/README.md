Many use XML to store configuration data, some use INI files others use Windows Registries and some like JSON. But given the fact that Python is such a powerful language, its easy to create/use such representations. PyDON stands for Python Dictionary Object Notation. It LOOKS similar to JSON but doesn't require you to create any parsers. Plus it can contain Python code which is even better :-).

A mechanism for communication from any thread to the main thread.

It uses the same custom Event, but adds a classmethod convenience for taking a callback and params, wrapping it into an event and posting it to the receiver. Also adds in support for weak method references to the callback, in case the source object gets deleted before its callback is actually called.

Merges forks of both:

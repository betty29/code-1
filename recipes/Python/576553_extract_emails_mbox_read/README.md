The Python `mailbox.mbox` class require a real file to initialize, which was an issue in my case. These simple functions let you iter through a mailbox read from a read-only file descriptor (like `sys.stdin`).

This script use the generators which were introduced in Python-2.2. Let me know if you are interested a similar functionnality on older Python versions.

Sometimes you want to work more with the form of an XML document than with the structural information it contains. For instance if you wanted to change a bunch of entity references or element names. Also, sometimes you have slightly incorrect XML that a traditional parser will choke on. In that case you want an XML lexer or "shallow parser". This is a Python implementation.

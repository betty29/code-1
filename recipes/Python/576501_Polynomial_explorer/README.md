Polynomial explorer. You tell this module what order of polynomial you want and it will set up a figure with a graph of that polynomial plotted with x = -1 to +1. It will set up a second figure with a set of coefficient axes. You can click on the coeffiecient axes to set the coefficents. The graph will then update to reflect the values of the new coefficients.

Search and replace files recursively in a given directory. Accepts regular expressions as search and replacement patterns.

**Example usage**:

    python find_replace_regex.py ".", "<span[^>]*>", "<div>", "*.html" backup

**Note**:
On win32 the `<` and `>` symbols are interpreted by the shell as input/output redirection even when they are surrounded with single or double quotes, and therefore need to be escaped with the caret character `^`.

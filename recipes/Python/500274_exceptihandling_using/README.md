The logic of the code is a rewrite of http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/408937, however partial is used here and default Exception class is added when no input is given. I have also made some modifications in the way handlers and exception classes are passed to the decorator. (it was earlier posted in comments for the same receipe)

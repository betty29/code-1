There are 3 chaotic functions to graph as examples.

Graph of function (0) is a curve.
Graph of function (1) is a group of lines.
(Both are Xn+1 = f(Xn) type functions.)

Graph of function (2) on the other hand is a plane.
(It is Xn+1 = f(Xn, Xn-1) type function.)

These mean there is a simple relationship between the 
previous and next X values in (0) and (1). (Next X value can always be predicted from the previous X value by using the graph of the function w/o knowing the function itself.) 
But (2) does not have a discernible relationship. (No prediction possible!) 
So (2) is clearly more chaotic than others.
(I think it could be used as a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).)

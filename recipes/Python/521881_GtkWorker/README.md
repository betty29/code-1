I got inspired to this class, after having read about the java SwingWorker.
The problem is that you sometimes have a tough task you want to do in a GUI program, but you don't want the UI to lock.
This recipe solves the problem by running the tough code in a background thread, while still letting you do useful interaction with it, like getting the progress or the latest results.

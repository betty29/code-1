The Boost.Bind library
http://www.boost.org/libs/bind/bind.html
, which I use a lot in C++, has a very nice implementation of the Curry technique. The main innovation of the library is usage of 'placeholders', which allows 'currying' arbitrary parameters in the arg list (please see discussion section). I missed this library in Python, and reimplementing it in a dynamic language was a piece of cake (and I did not have to yell at my compiler to get it done ;). Enjoy!

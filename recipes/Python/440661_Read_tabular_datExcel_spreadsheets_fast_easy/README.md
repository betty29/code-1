Sometimes you get an Excel spreadsheet (say, from the marketing departement) and you want to read tabular data from it (i.e. a line with column headers and lines of data). There are many ways to do this (including ODBC + mxODBC), but the easiest way I've found is this one : provide a file name and a sheet name, and read the data !

No comments about the use of "eval()" as Python Version 1.4.0 does not
have "int()" and this is designed to work on all versions of Python
available for the above platform. See the code for minimum requirements
and much more information.

MANY THANKS to Irmen de Jong for porting early versions of Python to

This code will probably make the professionals cough a little, but, boy
what fun it is to see how powerful Python can be on an open platform
like the AMIGA.

Written in such a way that anyone can understand how it works...

I really don't care how you vote this as it is for those, including

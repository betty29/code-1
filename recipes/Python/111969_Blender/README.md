is a very simple templating-system.
the goals of this 'system' were
- easy to use and to learn
  cheetah and yaptu for example was much to complex to
  install and learn and did a lot of things i didnt need.
- easy to change.
  blender is going to be used and serviced by python newbies.
  there is absolutely no chance to have something like
  complex regexes, evaluation or automatically including
  the namespaces and the like.
- much cooler name than 'yaptu' ;-)

Sometimes we are getting HTML input from the user.  We want to only allow valid, undangerous tags, we want all tags to be balanced (i.e. an unclosed <b> will leave all text on your page bold), and we want to strip out all Javascript.

This recipe demonstrates how to do this using the sgmllib parser to parse HTML.

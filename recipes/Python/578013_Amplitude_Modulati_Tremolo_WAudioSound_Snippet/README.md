This IS for the big guns as well as the amatuer...

I am always being told that too many comments inside any code is bad and that professional coders are clever enough to work out what a program does without comments...

So here goes! This snippet of code hits /dev/dsp in Linux and has no comments as to what it does.
Make sure that /dev/dsp is available in your Linux install - if not then install oss.compat from your repository.

It needs Python 2.6 minimum, but may well work on a much earlier version

Don't run the code first but have a go at working out what it does and see if you are correct... ;o)

You can email me if you think you are/were correct:-   wisecracker_at_tesco.net

Bear in mind I don't think this has ever been done before by hitting the /dev/dsp __directly__.

NOTE:- NO imports are required at all!!!

It runs for about 7 seconds before exiting...

Another BIG PLUS for Linux.

(I have a feeling poeple on here might like this, possibly even vote it up. ;)

Answer now at the bottom of this page...

Enjoy...

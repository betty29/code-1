Multithreaded Python programs often ignore the SIGINT generated by a
Keyboard Interrupt, especially if the thread that gets the signal is
waiting or sleeping.  This module provides a workaround by forking a
child process that executes the rest of the program while the parent
process waits for signals and kills the child process.

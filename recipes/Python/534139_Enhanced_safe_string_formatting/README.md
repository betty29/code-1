Ever found "str" % (a,b) a bit limited?
Do you want to supply some arguments now, and fill the rest in later?
Or mix positional and named arguments, i.e. supply a tuple and a dict?
Do you want to put string templates in a configuration file to be read with ConfigParser?
I hope you like this recipe.

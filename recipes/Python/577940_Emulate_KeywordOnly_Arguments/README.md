Python 3 introduced a useful feature: keyword-only arguments.  In order to get the same effect in Python 2, you must use **kwargs in your parameter list.  Then, at the beginning of your function body you must manually extract what would be the keyword-only arguments once you upgrade to 3.

This recipe helps reduce the boilerplate to a single function call.  You still don't get those parameters in your "def" clause (where they are more obvious), but at least it reduces the clutter.

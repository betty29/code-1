This vector class stores elements in a list and hence allows the 'vector' to grow
dynamically. Common mathematical functions (sin, cosh, etc) are supported elementwise
and so are a number of 'external' operations (dot for the inner product between vectors,
norm, sum etc.).  This class does not rely on NumPy but can be used in conjunction with
a 'sparse' matrix class to solve linear systems. Tested using Python 2.0 and Jython 2.0.

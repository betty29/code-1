markdowndoc is a pydoc extension that allows you to autogenerate API docs for websites that use Markdown. We specifically developed it with Gitorious's wikis in mind, but it should work for other wikispaces and, of course, ActiveState. You can see a few examples of it [here](http://gitorious.org/projects/python-markdown-api-builder/pages/Home).

Short Form prevents the Python shell from printing out giant piles of text.
It is a hack that ties into the display system.  When you are working with a multi-megabyte text file, referenced under the name `txt`, which takes 10 minutes to be printed in full (if you accidentally type '>>> txt') it's really nice to have this.

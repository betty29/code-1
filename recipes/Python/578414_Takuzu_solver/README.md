A Takuzu solver implemented using Google's Constraint Programming solver, part of the or-tools project.

A Takuzu board consists of a square grid of binary cells. There must be an equal number of 0s and 1s in every row and column, no duplicate rows or columns, and no more than two of the same bit consecutive in every row and column.

A friend was wondering how to implement MineSweep and decided to try making the game in Excel. Unfortunately, the game was not quite as interactive as he wanted; and he is unable to get around certain limitations at the moment since he is still new to programming. To show off the power of Python and demonstrate how easy it can be to develop a simple demonstration program in the language, the following program (and its iterations) were put together between the hours of 1 and 6 in the morning. It could certainly be much better in its implementation, but any serious work were to be put into MineSweep, starting over from scratch would be the best choice (especially with interface design).

SAX is commonly used on large XML files because they don't fit nicely into core memory necessary for the friendlier DOM API.

When dealing with -really- large XML files, multiple passes over the file becomes costly.

The SAX handler in this recipe allows you to handle an XML file multiple ways in a single pass by dispatching to the handlers you supply.

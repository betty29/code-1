Rename MP3 files in the current folder according to ID3 tags. This is based on Ned Batchelder's id3reader class. I only added the code in the `__main__` method.

* When run without arguments, the script renames the files in the current folder. The directory can be specified explicitly as the first argument.
* The files do not need to necessarily have the `MP3` extension.
* To move the files to directories based on album name use the `-d` switch.
* Does not work with other file types, such as OGG, M4A, MP4, etc.
* This is a quick and dirty script that works for me most of the times. If you need more power, try mutagen, picard, mp3tag or something similar.

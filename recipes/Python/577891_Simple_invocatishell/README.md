Some simple wrappers around the subprocess functions for use in system administration utilities that frequently need to interpolate trusted data into shell commands (e.g. filenames from directory listings, etc):

    import shellcmd
    return_code = shellcmd.shell_call('ls -l {}', dirname)
    listing = shellcmd.check_shell_output('ls -l {}', dirname)

Each function invokes the subprocess function of the same name with ``shell=True`` and the supplied command string. Any positional and keyword arguments provided to the call are interpolated into the command string with the ``str.format`` method.

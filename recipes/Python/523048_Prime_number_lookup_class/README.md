Uses an array to store the values, expands the size of the prime list on the fly, you can make a guess at how many you will need.
I am finding it useful for the problems at http://projecteuler.net
Any thoughts for improvement appreciated (I am going to try and neaten it up with a few list comprehensions and possibly speed up the initial array creation)

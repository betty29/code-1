PyMuPDF (fitz) provides easy to use ways to create PDF documents out of simple texts.

An example is the text output of Python's calendar module. Here we take a starting year as script parameter and output a 3-page (A4 landscape) document with calendars for this and the following two years - in less than 20 lines of code.

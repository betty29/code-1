I took this well-know game to design my own solution, and make a GUI for it.

To run the program, you will need to create a txt file with rows of dots, so like this:

......
......
......
......


and name it empty_board.gol
 (I have tested this program withwith 55x55)

It is functional and not object oriented.

My game of life algorithm is probably not the best one around (suggestions welcome), but I think this program is a nice demo of with tkinter can do and how easy it is to program GUI's with tkinter.

It has been written and tested in python 3.4 but I guess any version 3 should work, and probably only minor changes are needed to make it work in 2.6 or 2.7  (e.g. change tkinter to Tkinter).

This is not for the big guns, but for the Amateur coder AND radio enthusiast.

It is a DEMO Morse Code Generator and tutor that will generate the tones required for
the original standard letters A to Z and numbers 0 to 9. Puctuation is NOT included but
hey it is SOOOO simple to modify the code that I will let you, (the ones interested),
do that for yourselves... ;o)
Read the code for more informaton.

It is for at least standard text mode Python 2.5.2 to 2.7.2 using PCLinuxOS 2009 and
Debian 6.0.0. It may well work at a much earlier version. I do have a version for
Python 3.x.x but that will be uploaded elsewhere.

As it stands it _sends_ at around 8 WPM, (Words Per Minute).

It is written in such a way that youngsters can understand what is going on.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

This recipe lets you take into account time spent in C modules when profiling your Python code.  Normally the profiler only profiles Python code, so finding out how much time is spent accessing a database, running encryption code, sleeping and so on is difficult.  Profilewrap makes it easy to profile C code as well as Python code, giving you a clearer picture of where your application is spending its time.

Profilewrap demonstrates how to create proxy objects at runtime that intercept calls between pre-existing pieces of code.  It also demonstrates the use of the 'new' module to create new functions on the fly.

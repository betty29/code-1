Hi everyone,
This script can decode 4-Bit ( 16-Color ) and 8-Bit ( 256-Color ) Windows BMP files encoded with BI_RLE compression algorithm. However, I haven't got acceptable compressed BMP files ( row,column,zigzag etc. ), i could not try move offset marker data of BI_RLE. 

I'm waiting your comments for better solutions.

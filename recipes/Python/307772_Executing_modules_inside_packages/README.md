Python 2.4 provides the '-m' option to run a module as a script. However, "python -m &lt;script&gt;" will report an error if the specified script is inside a package.

Putting the following code in a module called "execmodule.py" and placing it in a directory on sys.path allows scripts inside packages to be executed using "python -m execmodule &lt;script&gt;".

Python version of the MSDN VBScript example for using SendKeys. The example uses the Windows calculator and sends keystrokes to execute a simple calculation. The codes to use with SendKeys are documented at http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm?/scripting/windowshost/doc/wsMthSendKeys.htm

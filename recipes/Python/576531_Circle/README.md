Circle is a program for students and tutors in higher education. Circle program provide the user with the standard form ( x â€“x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2  = r^2, radius and centre(x0,y0), once the user input the Constants' values of the circle Equation of the form Ax^2 + Ay^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. if r^2 = 0, Circle program point and display that the graph is the single point (x0,y0), and if r^2 < 0 , Circle program point that the equation has no real solutions, thus no graph. However Circle program also does compute and display the reverse method if the user input the radius and centre values, it display both forms of the circle equation

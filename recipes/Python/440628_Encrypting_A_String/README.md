The main purpose of these functions are to encrypt and decrypt a string (or change the string from one "language" into another). I'm guessing that Python already has something like this, but this is my implementation of the process. The code is simple, but it provides a simple solution to a well-known encryption scheme. As a recommendation, this may be better when used in conjunction with an encoding system (such as the base 256 to base 255 encoded that I submitted).

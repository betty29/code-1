Really short snipped of a decimal and binary prefix calculator in Python.

Without covering the entire International System of Units (SI) range, it does fit my daily needs.  
The code could be *way* smarter, but i wanted to keep the recipe as basic as i could.

Tested on `Python 2.4.1` and `2.6.4;` could work on lower as well.

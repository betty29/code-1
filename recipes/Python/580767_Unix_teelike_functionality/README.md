The Unix tee commmand, when used in a command pipeline, allows you to capture the output of the preceding command to a file or files, while still sending it on to standard output (stdout) for further processing via other commands in a pipeline, or to print it, etc.

This recipe shows how to implement simple tee-like functionality via a Python class. I do not aim to exactly replicate the functionality of the Unix tee, only something similar.

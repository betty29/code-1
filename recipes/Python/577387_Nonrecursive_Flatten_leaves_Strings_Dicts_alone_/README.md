I have written Flatten a few dozen times, and also searched the interwebs - I don't feel good about a heavily recursive function for Python, and some of the "type-sniffing" I saw in some codes seemed fishy - so I coded up this version.  At least this increases the options.
Handles strings, dictionaries, generators, sequences, lists, tuples -- in sensible ways.  Handles arbitrarily deep levels of nesting.  Does the bare minimum of type-sniffing.  With Doctest tests.

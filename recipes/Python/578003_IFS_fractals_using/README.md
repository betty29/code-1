This method uses inverse IFS transformations (assume new x, new y are known and x, y are unknown and solve the equation), and unlike IFS algorithm, it does not use a random number generator and neither the probability coefficients for each IFS transformation.
(Except when IFS algorithm is used in the beginning to find bounding rectangle of the fractal.)

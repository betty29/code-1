A simple implementation of a dictionary which always (when applicable) returns keys, values, items (key-value pairs) sorted by keys (inserting/removing order doesn't matter and only keys are important; so please note that it is something different than OrderedDict in Python 3.1/2.7 or Django's SortedDict).

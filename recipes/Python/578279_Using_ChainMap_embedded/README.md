The Zen of Python tells us:

*Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!*

Python already has an excellent namespace type, the module, but the problem with modules is that they have to live in a separate file, and sometimes you want the convenience of a single file while still encapsulating your code into namespaces. That's where classes are the usual solution, but classes need to be instantiated and methods need to be defined with a `self` parameter.

C++ has "namespaces" for encapsulating related objects and dividing the global scope into sub-scopes. Can we do the same in Python?

With a bit of metaclass trickery and the new ChainMap type from Python 3.3, we can!

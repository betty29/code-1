These classes subclass several of the culprits in twisted.web.xmlrpc that are responsible for not being able to make autenticated XML-RPC calls.

Note that this recipe also makes use of the URI classes that were posted in a previous recipe here:
  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/473864

I will submit a patch to twisted along these lines, but there will be no references to the custom Uri module or code.

Update: XML-RPC Authentication is now supported in Twisted (version 2.4 included a patch based on this recipe). If you are using a recent version of Twisted or can update to a recent version, this recipe is no longer needed.

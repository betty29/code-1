This module is a tiny winamp implementation using ctypes, which presents mp3/wav/mid/ogg... playback in python by calling winamp plugins. Treating it as a little example for advanced ctypes usage. You can download the full demo (in_mp3.dll, out_wave.dll, sample.mp3 included) from:  http://www.joynb.net/blog/up/1166948100.rar  -- by skywind3000@hotmail.com

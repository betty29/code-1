toast?
ok so im working on a program that takes a randomly generated word
n scrambles all the letters out 

then it spits out the letters (which are still scrambled)
it will ask the users to type what they think the word is
they get 10 tries before they lose 


the code so far has no bugs in it i just need to know the small piece / block of code 
that will scramble the letters in randwrd (this will be seen in the code)

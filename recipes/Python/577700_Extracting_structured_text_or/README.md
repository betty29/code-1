This function uses the power of regular expressions to extract parts of a structured text string. It can build a token list from many types of code and data formats. It finds string types (with quotes) and nested structures that use parentheses, brackets, and braces. If you need to extract a different syntax, you can provide a custom token pattern in the function arguments.

If you need to do something irregularly, randomly during the day, you
often forget. This script gives you mail, sms or popup window indefinitely in
random interval to remind you of doing it. It runs forever. If you want to
send emails, uncomment the row sendMail() and fill variable me, to, smtp,
name, login in function sendMail().

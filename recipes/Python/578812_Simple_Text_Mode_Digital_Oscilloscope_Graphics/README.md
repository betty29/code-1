This is a DEMO to switch a *NIX terminal from text to _graphics_ mode on the fly.

The graphics characters are limited to lowercase 'a' through 'z' and
this DEMO just prints a small subset to see what a fun, kids level, 8
channel Logic-Analyser/Digital-Oscilloscope might look like.

This may not work in every *NIX style terminal but does work on default
terminals using bash on OSX 10.7.5, PCLinuxOS 2009 and Debian Linux 6.0.x.

Tested on Python 2.5.x to 3.3.2 on the above platforms...
(It might work on earlier versions of Python but untested.)

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

Reads an image file from the filename specified as the 1st parameter on the command line and displays it on screen. Uses the PIL module so that it can load almost any image file type supported by that module and uses Tkinter to display the image on a Tkinter canvas.

I'm new to Python so excuse the clunkyness of implementation.

This is a modification of code posted at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577715/ (r3)

The original code produces a png image using the PIL module.
It generates a Random 2D Slice of a 4D Mandelbrot Fractal.

This extends the program into 3D with Visual Python 5.4, running under Python 2.7.1

Changing vp_flag from 0 to 1 will restore program to original functionality.
The program is interactive with keys q,w,e,r and x used to control visual points object.

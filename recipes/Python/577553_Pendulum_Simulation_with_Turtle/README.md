This program was written per R.T.Giles's second assignment in 10COF180 (November 25, 2010). A student under his instruction wanted help writing a program, and while not required, a GUI was placed on the program's output to visually demonstrate what was taking place within the program. The recipe below provides a simple simulation of a undamped pendulum and produces a visual representation for about thirty seconds. The code could be greatly improved but gives a demonstration of what a few turtle commands can do in Python. Very little code must be written to produce graphics on the computer screen.

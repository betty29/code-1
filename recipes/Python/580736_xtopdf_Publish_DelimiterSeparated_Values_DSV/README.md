This recipe shows how to publish delimiter-separated values (a commonly used tabular data format) to PDF, using the xtopdf toolkit for PDF creation. It lets the user specify the delimiter via one of two command-line options - an ASCII code or an ASCII character. As Unix filters tend to do, it can operate either on standard input or on input filenames given as command-line arguments. In the case of multiple inputs via files, each input goes to a separate PDF output file.

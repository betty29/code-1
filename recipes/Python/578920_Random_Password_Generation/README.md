Generate a password (or other secure token) using a pattern language similar to regular expressions. We'll use the `strgen` module that enables a user to generate test data, unique ids, passwords, vouchers or other randomized data very quickly using a template language. The template language is superficially similar to regular expressions but instead of defining how to match or capture strings, it defines how to generate randomized strings.

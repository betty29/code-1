The standard ray tracing algorithm seems unnatural to me because everytime a ray reflects/refracts all (primitive) objects in the scene must be tested for intersection; no matter where they located!


In this method there is no such thing. It just moves each ray voxel by voxel until it hits an opaque/reflective(/refractive) voxel.


I made many simplifications so the image is crude.

This recipe shows how to read and process delimiter-separated values (DSV) data with a Python command-line program. It provides two ways of specifying the delimiter character, by an ASCII character or an ASCII code, which makes it more flexible than allowing only a character. It allows the DSV data to be specified as one or more filenames on the command line, or given via the standard input of the program.

This code shows an implementation of tunneling. Though this code uses ssl as an example. It would not be hard to modify it to work for other situations as well.

The reason I use ssl as an example is because the standard python libraries do not support tunneling ssl through a proxy. Import pytunnel and give it a function w/the code you want to tunnel and your off.

For the latest code try:

The Script converts all doc and docx files in a specified folder to pdf files. It checks whether the provided absolute path does actually exist and whether the specified folder contains any doc and docx files. It does not travers the directory recursively. The script is not portable and runs only a Windows machine. Based on the experience I made, I recommend closing MS Word before running the script.

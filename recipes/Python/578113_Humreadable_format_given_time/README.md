**What is it about?**

 * I need to say someting like *1 day ago*, *5 days ago*, *2 weeks ago*, ...
 * I can control to have it with/without milliseconds and microseconds.
 * I can use it automatically with current date and time or with a provide one.

**Why?**

 * I need it for next revision of my recipe 578111.
 * I found recipes here and there but often it is always assumed that a month has 30 days and that a year has 365 days; this is not true. That's why I've left away months and years.

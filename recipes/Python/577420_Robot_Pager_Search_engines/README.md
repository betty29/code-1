This is a class to make easy the development of robots, to parse results over a website with a paging. For example Google, Yahoo, Bing, or any other page with paging system.

PagerEngine is the main class. I've developed three more clases implementing GoogleSearch, YahooSearch and BingSearch as examples.

Inheriting from PagerEngine (and having RexExp knowledge) you can easily develop other robots for other websites.

To ensure that the "byt2str" module operates correctly, the following unit test has been devised. This recipe should ensure the correctness of the code and validate all corrections for accuracy when run. If you are not familiar with the "unittest" or "test" modules, this code may of be interest for the purpose of developing your own library validation suites. Testing code is important for providing a certain amount of assurance that the code being run is correct. If the code is changed incorrectly, a test like this should be able to detect a problem.

This implements polynomial functions over a single variable in Python.  It represents the polynomial as a list of numbers and allows most arithmetic operations, using conventional Python syntax.  It does not do symbolic manipulations.  Instead, you can do things like this:

    x = SimplePolynomial()
    eq = (x-1)*(x*1)
    print eq     # prints 'X**2 - 1'
    print eq(4)  # prints 15

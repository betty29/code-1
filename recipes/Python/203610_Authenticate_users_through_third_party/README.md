Here's an example of how an existing POP-mail account can be used to provide authentication to a python application.

The user doesn't have to remember yet another password, and the administrator doesn't have to handle users who forgot... Instead, we associate all our users to some external POP-mail account. When they want to log in to our system, we ask them for the password to their email account.

If we can log in to the pop server using their password, and just get a status from their mailbox (we don't peek of course) we decide that the user has authenticated himself.

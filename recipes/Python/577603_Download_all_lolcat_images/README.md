Running this python script will download all lolcat images from icanhascheezburger.com to the current folder. Download will start from the oldest image. Images are collected into subfolders lolcat0, lolcat1 etc, each containing 300 images. The script can be stopped and resumed at anytime.
Make sure to create files *lolconfig.txt* and *log.txt* in the same folder before running the script. *lolconfig.txt* must have a string as follows in the beginning: *1496/1496/0*. 
log.txt is an empty file in the beginning

This recipe shows how to serve PDF from a server written using Netius, a pure-Python library, together with xtopdf, a Python toolkit for PDF creation. It is a proof-of-concept recipe, to show the essentials needed for the task, so it hard-codes the text content that is served as PDF, but the concepts shown can easily be extended to serve dynamically generated PDF content.

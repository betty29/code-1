File I/O has many potential uses, and in the case of network file shares, messaging can be conducted by creating files in a directory and scanning for new files to find new messages. In the case where there are restrictions within a network that prevent opening server sockets or creating and using client sockets, the technique in this recipe may be used with file shares instead. The program is simple and was written in about fifty minutes, so there are a great deal of enhancements that could be made to the recipe and its capabilities. Hopefully, this will provide inspiration for other program writers.

This recipe shows how to publish data from the Firebird RDBMS to PDF, using the xtopdf toolkit and the fbd Python driver for Firebird. Firebird is a cross-platform, open source RDBMS based on the former Interbase RDBMS from Borland, which they used to bundle with some of their developmemt tools, such as Borland C++ and Borland Delphi.

The recipe reads data from a Firebird table, using the fbd Python driver for Firebird, and writes it to PDF, using the xtopdf toolkit. See:

http://jugad2.blogspot.in/p/xtopdf-pdf-creation-library.html

for information on xtopdf.

It assumes that a Firebird database called test.fdb exists under /temp/firebird (C:\temp\firebird, really - the test was done on Windows), and that it has a contacts table with the structure shown in the code of the recipe.

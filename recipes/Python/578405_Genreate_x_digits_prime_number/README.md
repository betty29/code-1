This is a prime number generator in python that I put together for an article I wrote [How To Find Prime Numbers In Python](http://thelivingpearl.com/2013/01/06/how-to-find-prime-numbers-in-python/). The script will generate a prime number of x digits, where x is less than 15. It might work for larger x, but it will take a while.

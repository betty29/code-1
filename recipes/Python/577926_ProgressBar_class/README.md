Progress bars are popular when trying to
show how much of a job has been completed.
In my case, it was encrypting and decrypting
files. A GUI interface was written, but
something was lacking. How was the user of
the program supposed to know if the program
was doing its job? A progress bar seemed like
a good answer, so a simple GUI progress bar
was written using Tkinter.

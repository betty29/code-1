Removes ">From" and "From " lines from mail headers.

Thunderbird adds invalid mail headers to it's local folders.  Cyrus IMAP is strict about them.  This script walks through all files in the given directories and removes any line that starts with ">From" or "From " (note the space and no colon).

Requires Python 2.5+.

This is a program Jon Bentley asked Donald Knuth to write, and is one thatâ€™s become familiar to people who use languages with serious text-handling capabilities: Read a file of text, determine the n most frequently used words, and print out a sorted list of those words along with their frequencies. I wrote 2 solutions for it earlier, in Python and in Unix shell. Also see the comment by a user on the post, giving another solution.

Sometimes it is useful to make sure that arguments in a function are positional only, i.e. cannot be passed as keywords.
This recipe defines a decorator 'posonly' that does this: arguments cannot be passed as keywords.  Note that **kwargs can still be used in the function definition to accept keywords.

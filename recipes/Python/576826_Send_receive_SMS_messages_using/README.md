[TextMagic](http://www.textmagic.com) is a provider of SMS services. Their SMS gateway is accessible via an HTTPS API. A convenient wrapper for this API is [PyTextMagicSMS](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyTextMagicSMS/). Full documentation and source code is available on the project's [website](https://github.com/dfstrauss/textmagic-sms-api-python).

In order to use the service, you need to register at http://www.textmagic.com/ and obtain an API password (different from your login password) at https://www.textmagic.com/app/wt/account/api/cmd/password

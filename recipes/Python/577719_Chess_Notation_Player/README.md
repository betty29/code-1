This allows you to input the algebraic chess notation of a game, move by move, and the position of the pieces will be shown on the screen. The upper case letters represent Black pieces and the lower case letters represent White pieces. Most notations are accepted, including Castling and Disambiguating. For details on Algebraic Chess notation see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_chess_notation.

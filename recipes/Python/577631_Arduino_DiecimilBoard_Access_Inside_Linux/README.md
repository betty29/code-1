This is a simple Python example of accessing a(n) Arduino Diecimila Board using Standard Python 2.x.x.

This code requires NO PySerial to work, just standard Linux(/Unix?) commands and a Standard Python install.

The only prerequisite is that a root terminal is needed to start Python in.

This code is released as Public Domain and you can do with it as you please.

To get more values displayed it is best to use a potentiometer wired as one end to +5V, the other end to Gnd
and the wiper to ANALOG IN 0. This has been tested on various Linux Distros and kept as simple as possible so
that anyone can understand it.

The required ?.pde file for the Arduino Board can be found here:-

Similar assumptions are made as in the URL above.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

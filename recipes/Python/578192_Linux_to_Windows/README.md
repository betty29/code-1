When trying to work with Linux archive downloaded onto Windows, sometimes it is helpful to untar all found archives, give extension-less files the "txt" extension, and convert text files to Windows line endings (\r\n), and that is just what this program is designed to accomplish. This is committed for archival to be run under Python 2.5 or later versions.

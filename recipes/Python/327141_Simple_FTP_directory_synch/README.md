This script filled the need to have a scheduled directory synch occur via FTP.  I also realized I could use it to clean out a directory without much effort.  There are probably more robust examples out there, but this one should be easily modifiable for FTP newbies.  It uses Sets to speed up finding missing files from the local directory.

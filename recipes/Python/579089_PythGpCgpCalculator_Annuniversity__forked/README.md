Actually this python script is a forked one from activestate code by abhijeeth vaidya.A slightly edited version of the script to calculate Gpa and Cgpa for Anna university Students.

Gpa and Cgpa Calculator

Gpa is Grade point average, which is use to determine the student academic pointer based on the value of the grade he/she acquired in single semester, where as cgpa is cumlative grade point average is to calculate the total credits and total grade acquired in his/her entire academics. Here i have determined to use grade scale of two values 5.0 and 10.0, many other academics may have different grading system.For a different grades and their grade values, You can change the value in method called getGradeData.For any bug report

Uses lxml.etree to convert a Python object consisting of nested dicts, tuples, lists, strings and string-convertable objects into a very basic no-attributes, untyped dialect of XML in which elements are named after dictionary keys, and "<i>" is the element for anonymous list and tuple items.

Does not support: encoding or decoding of strings, invalid floating point values, detection of circular references.

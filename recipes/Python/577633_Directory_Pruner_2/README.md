This program builds on work done in recipe 577632, adds new options to the context menu, and experiments with threading the GUI. Directory Pruner 2 appear to work better on Windows 7 while Directory Pruner 1 (the non-threaded version) performs better on Windows XP. Those are the primary platforms on which the two programs have been tested. Please use these applications at your own risk.

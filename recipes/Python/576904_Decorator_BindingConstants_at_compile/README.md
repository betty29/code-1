Decorator for automatic code optimization. If a global is known at compile time, replace it with a constant. Fold tuples of constants into a single constant. Fold constant attribute lookups into a single constant.

This is only an update of Recipe 277940, making it compatible with Python 3. All credit must go to the original author, Raymond Hettinger.

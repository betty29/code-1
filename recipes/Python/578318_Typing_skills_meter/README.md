A Tkinter-based program that shows your typing skills (speed and error rate) in the form of a car dashboard

The text to type is displayed in a text zone, the cursor and the dashboard needles progress as you type the letters. Text can be copied-pasted, or loaded from a file that users can store in the subfolder "texts"

The interface language can be configured (in this version, only French-English, but easily extendable to other languages)

After considering the monolithic design of recipe 577633 and deciding that it should be divided into several smaller modules, Directory Pruner 3 was written to take advantage of better abstraction methodologies. There are a total of twelve files in the project, and all of them except the first are contained within a directory called "Directory Pruner 3" such that they make up a package in Python. Like the other Directory Pruners, please use and configure this program at your own computer's risk.

If you have any comments or wish to vote this recipe down, please provide an explanation as to what you find fault with in this program and also a solution that you would implement to fix the problem.

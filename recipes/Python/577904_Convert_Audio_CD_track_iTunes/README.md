This script would do convert tracks from an audio cd into Apple lossless music using iTunes.

When we have a bad cd rom or a bad disk, conversion would usually fail and iTunes would not complain about it. I usually have to check every converted track manually. This script would save the pain: it would check every converted track, if the duration of the converted track is less than the original track, the script would retry the conversion.

This script is inspired by [Fabien C.](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/users/4010550/) 's Recipe 498241.

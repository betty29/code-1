DC, (Direct Current), Input For Text Mode Python 3.x.x.

A kids level project to do for yourselves...

This is a Python DEMO to show the power of the sound card using Linux to
accept a DC, (Direct Current), input. It is a kids level project that uses
the sound card microphone input as a detector for an audio VCO output.

Written in such a way that anyone can understand how it works...

The DEMO circuits inside the code are SOOO simple a dexterous 10 year
old could make it in less than a couple of hours and have it up and running
so as to start using it... The DEMO code is a simple, slow, positive logic,
TTL level Logic Probe.

(My own VCO circuit is almost as simple but has 5 transistors.)

This is for Linux and Python 3.x.x. Read the code for much more information, and......

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...

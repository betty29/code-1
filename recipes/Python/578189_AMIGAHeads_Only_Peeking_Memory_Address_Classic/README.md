For AMIGA-Heads Only...

This code is purely for a minimum of a stock Classic AMIGA A1200(HD), E-UAE, and WinUAE running AMIGA OS3.0x to 3.1x. It will NOT work on any other platform!

(It MIGHT work on AMIGA OS3.5x and 3.9x with Python 2.4.6, but totally untested and I hold no responsibility for the outcome when trying it.)

It is a DEMO to peek a byte inside _ANY_ memory address inside the standard CPU 68EC020 16MB boundary.

I experimented with this several years ago and have decided to finally release it. I do await the flak!

It works from Python Versions 1.4.0 to 2.0.1 for the classic AMIGA.

Ensure that the T: Volume exists on the running machine.

See inside the code and text below it also as to how it works...

Bazza, G0LCU...

This function will display a nicely formatted textual table for you. Features include: auto-sizing of columns, auto-alignment based on column-type (which it sniffs from the first row), nicely formated centered headings, and most importantly wrapping of cells. Of course, you can manually override pretty much everything in case you don't like the defaults.

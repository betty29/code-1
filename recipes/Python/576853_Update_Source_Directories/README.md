A convenience script to update a pre-specified folder containing 
subversion, mercurial, bazaar, and/or git source folders

To use it: 
    
* change the 'src' variable below to point to your source folder

* name this script to something appropriate (I call it 'update')
    
* put it into a directory on your PATH

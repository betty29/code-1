Python does not support assignment in if and while statements such as "if (x=func()):". This is an attempt to bring similar functionality to python by injecting bytecode to all functions and methods in a module.
This recipe is inspired from recipes [66061](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66061), [202234](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/202234-assignment-in-expression) and [277940](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/277940-decorator-for-bindingconstants-at-compile-time).

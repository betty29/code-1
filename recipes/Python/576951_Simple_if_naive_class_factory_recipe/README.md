I'm a hack programmer -- no formal education.  So, I don't know if this is technically a "factory", "abstract factory" or something else.

It is a way to generate a class dynamically, perhaps based on run-time data.

The point is that you can take a blank class object and dynamically add a constructor, class attributes, and instance methods.  In principle, these could be configured dynamically in a program.

Since I don't know anything about programming theory, I welcome any criticism/discussion/suggestion.  But, please be gentle!

A friend was trying to open files with Korean names and was finding that Windows 7 was giving him errors. There were well over 22,000 files to deal with, and he did not want to rename them all individually. As a result, this program was quickly written to help him in renaming his vast assortment of files and folders so that he could easily open them in his resource viewer application.

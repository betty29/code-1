The recipe provides an easy-to-use class for a group of "constants".  It provides helper functions for getting the constant values just right.  It also exposes the mechanism it uses to bind the contents of an iterable into the namespace of another object.

For this binding and for the grouped constants, this recipe makes it easy to dynamically generate the mapped values you want to expose.

The next step is to make the values aware of the context in which they are bound and to strengthen their association with the group they are in.  And that is one of the recipes I'm working on next!

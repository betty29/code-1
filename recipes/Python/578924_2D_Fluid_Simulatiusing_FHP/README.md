2D Fluid Simulation using FHP LGCA (Lattice Gas Cellular Automata)

Simulates fluid flow in a circular channel.

It works really slow but I think it can be a lot faster if it modified for NumPy and possibly Py2Exe.

But my main goal was to provide easy to understand code (not performance) anyway.

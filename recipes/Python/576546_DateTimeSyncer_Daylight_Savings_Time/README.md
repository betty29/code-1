DateTimeSyncer synchronizes computer's current date and time with Daylight Savings adjustment
directly without depending on operating system or Python's time.localtime().

This allows programmers to update Daylight Savings Time rules without
depending on external updates to OS or Python.

Double-clicking this module will synchronize your computer's date and time on a Windows machine. It can be easily extended other time zones and other operating systems.

This is my Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, including functions to generate prime numbers from a password string. It also includes a file-like object for automating encryption.

I wrote this code a long time ago. My coding style has improved since then. I would never write a program like this nowadays. This was written as a demo, and should be treated as such.

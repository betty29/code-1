This recipe provides recursive nlst() behavior on top of a normal ftplib.FTP instance. The rnlst() method provided by the LocalFTP class returns a list of filenames under the path passed in as an argument.  (One use for this list might be mirroring an ftp site. However,  the python distribution contains a script called ftpmirror.py - use that instead.)

Best suited for use on fast local connections, or for use on relatively small remote ftp directories.

Please see code comments for additional information.

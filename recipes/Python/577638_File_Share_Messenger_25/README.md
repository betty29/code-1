After writing the limited program shown in recipe 577637, the following program was written with a better yet incompatible I/O system designed not to fill up a file share with many, separate files. This program had five revisions as outlined within the source code. To access settings within this program, use the "F2" key. Documentation may be accessed via the "F1" key (with future plans cut).

If anyone wishes to comment or vote this recipe down, please provide your insight into the fault(s) of the program and provide a suggestion as to what solution you would implement to fix the problems.

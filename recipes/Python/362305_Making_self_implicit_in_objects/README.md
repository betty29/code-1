People used to statically typed languages coming to Python often complain that you have to use "self" (or whichever name you want, but self is most common) to refer to a method or variable in that object. You also have to explicitly pass a reference to the method's object in every call to it. Many people new to Python are annoyed by this and feels that it forces a lot of unnecessary typing. This recipe presents a method which makes "self" implicit.

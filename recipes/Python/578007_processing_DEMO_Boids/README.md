Recipe 578004 provides a simple way of creating 2D graphical experiments based on http://processing.org/ and its easy-to-use Java framework. This module is meant to be a simple demonstration of that recipe and shows a simple BOIDs example that uses `processing`. Though the API is highly incomplete and slightly different, it shows what was inspired by the faster-running http://processing.org/learning/topics/flocking.html .

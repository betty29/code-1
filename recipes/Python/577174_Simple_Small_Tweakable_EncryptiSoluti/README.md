Encryption can sometimes be a nightmare, at least is my experience while Python has 
some excellent resources for encryption I found myself a lot of times needing an
encryption solution that could port easily between VS C++, .NET, PHP, and Python
projects that would be simple to implement and  not rely on large bloated 
crypto libs.

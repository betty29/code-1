Program to convert JPEG to PDF. Technically it just embeds the JPEG in a landscape US letter size PDF page. 
When you might need it?: When you have to scan a document and do not have scanner handy, you can take a photograph of the document with webcam, and embed the JPEG into PDF - effectively works as a scanner.

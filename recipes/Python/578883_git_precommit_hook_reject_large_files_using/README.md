This script should be saved in the templatedir, so it ends up in .git/hooks whenever you do a new git init.
By default, commits that contain files larger than 5 Mb are blocked. This is useful for preventing accidental large commits that are not caught by .gitignore. You can easily bypass the hook by specifing "--no-verify" with git commit. (in a previous version of this script, this did not work correctly)

This receipe provides lightweight functions for pickling objects to a DOM structure and vice versa. I use it in connection with <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/286150">Hierarchical Objecs</a> from receipe #286150.

<strong>This receipe makes use of eval(), so do not unpickle untrusted xml documents !!!</strong>. I add some secret checksums to my documents which I check before unpickling.

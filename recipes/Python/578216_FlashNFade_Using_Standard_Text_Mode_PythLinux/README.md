This DEMO shows how to fade text in shades of grey and also flash with inverse_flash along with simultaneous differing frequency beeps.

There are 2 code snippets that WILL need to be separated before use. One is a Linux version and the other a Windows 32 bit version. There is an AMIGA version but that is for much later.

There are NO notes inside the code so you will have to see the code as to how it works. It is SOOO simple that notes are/were unnecessary...

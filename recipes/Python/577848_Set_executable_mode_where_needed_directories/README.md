If you make a mess (like I did) and you removed all the executable permissions of a directory (or you set executable permissions to everything) this can help.

It will walk through a tree of files setting or unsetting the executable mode of files or directories. 

NOTE: Will autodetect executables if they contain the word ELF at the beggining, so it won't work in platforms that does not use ELF (windows, AIX, etc).

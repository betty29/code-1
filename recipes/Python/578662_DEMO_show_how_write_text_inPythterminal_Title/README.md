This DEMO is show how to write some text of your choice into the Title Bar of the Python terminal window.

Firstly it imports "time" just for this demo so that a simple time delay can be generated.
Next the Python terminal window is written to for the 5 seconds of delay; see code.
And finally the Title Bar is restored to normal...

The recipe is a direct descendant of the program presented here:
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/502251
This program was created at the suggestion of "Mark" (a friend
of mine), and so the game was named in his honor. A high score
table is supported and is automatically saved to and loaded from
a file if possible. The object of the game is to click on each
ball until it is purple. The score is based on how many seconds
are left on the clock in the bottom, left corner of the screen.
Have fun, and try to beat the game in sixty seconds or less; it
is possible!

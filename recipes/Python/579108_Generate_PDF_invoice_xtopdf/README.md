This recipe shows the basics of how to generate invoices as PDF documents, using xtopdf, a Python toolkit for PDF creation. An example of creating a simple invoice through Python and xtopdf code is shown. 

xtopdf is available on Bitbucket at:

https://bitbucket.org/vasudevram/xtopdf

and you can find many links with examples of using xtopdf, how to install it, etc., from this Google search:

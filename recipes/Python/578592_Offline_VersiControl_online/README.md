A basic form of version control that when used in combination with dropbox and notepad++ (optional) provides reliable backup with tags of files/folder.

Files mode can be used for individual files, in practice i used it with python files primarily.
Folder mode allows for backup of folders, especially useful for a class split over various files with __init__.py in root of a folder.

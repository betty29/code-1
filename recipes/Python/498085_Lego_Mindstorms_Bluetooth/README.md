The new Lego Mindstorms NXT brick has an on-board Bluetooth transceiver that can
connect to a serial port service on a PC.  The NXT uses a simple format to pass
raw bytes between connected Bluetooth devices.  This interface allows the NXT
brick to be controlled from Python.  Robot programming in Python anyone?

These buttons work like regular wx buttons and can be used the same way.

They are very dramatic and add a strong visual and artistic flair to your interface.
Use when there is something really significant and a regular button just doesn't cut it.

The buttons are drawn with gradient shading (no bitmaps).  They can be any size and support any font.

This source has a self-test.  Just run "python roundbutton.py".

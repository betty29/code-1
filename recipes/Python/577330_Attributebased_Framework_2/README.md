I am adapting Prof. David Cheriton's OO software methodology to Python. It's an approach for building industrial-strength code with a disciplined architecture, consistent naming conventions, and a rigorous division of interface from implementation. I'll be adding more of his techniques in further recipes. These recipes are based on Cheriton's CS249a course at Stanford.

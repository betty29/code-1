An anagram could be a word, or a sentence, of which the letters could be rearranged to form a different word, or a different sentence.




However, vowels and consonants could be combined to form a syllable.




Though, counting the numbers of vowels and consonants forming a word or a phrase, is a writing technique to enhance the writing style, and balance the phonetic. 




My program Anagrams, vowels, and consonants, allows you to compute the numbers of vowels, and consonants forming a word, a sentence, or a full text, and rearrange the letters forming every word within a text in every possible combination, thus, finding anagrams for each word within the sentence.

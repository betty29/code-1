This small snippet came about as a result of this discussion on python-ideas, requesting a new syntax for dynamically reevaluating a function each time it is called.

It is a minor alteration of version 2 of this recipe that, instead of calling eval() on string annotations, simply requires that the annotations be callable and calls them at runtime.

Pycol can be used by students to compute trigonometric functions,(Sine,Cosine,Tangent,Cosecant,Secant, and Cotangent) of an angle(X) expressed in degrees rather than radians, since this is not available in Python math or cmath modules.
Yet it is a standard method of measuring such ratios at colleges,universities and all mathematics books including Calculus.
Pycol can also be used to express angles from degrees into radians and vice versa, and into degrees, minutes, and seconds

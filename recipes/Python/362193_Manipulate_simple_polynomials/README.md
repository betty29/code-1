This package does simple polynomial manipulation: adding, multiplying, taking to powers, evaluating at a value, taking integrals and derivatives. Nothing as sophisticated as Mathematica, but useful all the same. I find that I make lots of dumb errors in multiplying out polynomials by hand (when I don't have Mathematica at my disposal), and this little script helps prevent those errors.

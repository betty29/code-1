Sometimes it is necessary to ensure that only one instance of application is running. This quite simple solution uses pid file to achieve this, and will run only on Linux platform.  This is a nearly compatible version to the Windows version posted by Dragan Jovelic (I fixed the mispelling of alreadyrunning method).

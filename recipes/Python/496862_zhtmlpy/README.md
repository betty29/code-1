This recipe requires the z_matrix module.
Two classes are provided, HTML_Table and HTML_Month.
HTML_Table can manage the generation of a table in HTML format.
HTML_Month builds on top of HTML_Table and expands on its capabilities.
It allows for dynamically created tables that have the look of the selected month.

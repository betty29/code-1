I am all about trying to make development easier and reduce mundane tasks, especially 
dealing with commandline args and getopt, OptParse, argparse sorry just not a fan. Argparse-cli
is really cool if you want low level control. I just got tired of writing tons of conditionals,                     labels, limited type handling, and having to do all of it over and over for every commandline project so help end the madness I wrote PyOpts.

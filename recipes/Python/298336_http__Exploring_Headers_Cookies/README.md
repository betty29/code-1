This CGI script allows you to specify a URL. It fetches the URL and displays all the headers sent by the server.
It is based on approx.py the CGI-proxy I'm building. It includes authentication circuitry and I'm using it to understand http authentication.

This script demostrates using urllib2 to fetch a URL - using a request object with User-Agent header. It also demostrates basic authentication and shows the possible http errors - using a dictionary 'borrowed' from BaseHTTPServer.

It will also save cookies using the ClientCookie module, if it's available.

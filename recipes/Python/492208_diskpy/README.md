The following recipe provides a simple
simulation of secondary memory and is
primarily designed to provide a driver
interface to a virtual hard drive. The
interface is simple and allows the
simulation of IO errors. Also provided
are methods that allow efficient storage
are retrieval of a disk object on the
computer's file system.

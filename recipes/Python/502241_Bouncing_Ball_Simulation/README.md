The physics system used in this simulation is
both incomplete and incorrect. This recipe evolved
from the Boids Simulation and was an early attempt
to simulate bouncing balls in an area contained
with a force field on the sides and a floor on the
bottom. The spheres will respond to movement of
the window and will bounce if accelerated upward
quickly. This is primarily a recipe that I later
built off of to create better software later on.

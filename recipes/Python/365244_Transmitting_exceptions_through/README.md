Python's xmlrpclib only raises the xmlrpclib.Fault exception, but it can be convenient to allow more different kinds of exceptions to be raised.  This recipe provides a customized subclass of xmlrpclib.ServerProxy that looks for Fault exceptions where the message is of the form <exception name>:<message>, and raises the corresponding exception.

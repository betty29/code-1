Example shows how to unset gtk engine'd look for a particular widget.

gtk.Widget.modify_xx allows you to override simple properties, like backgrounds (unless theme uses an engine) and text color (sometimes (?))
gtkrc allows you to override most properties for all or selected widgets, like sizes, faces, and so on.
some parts of widget appearance are set through engine stanzas in gtkrc, these can be unset too, if you know how...

here it is!

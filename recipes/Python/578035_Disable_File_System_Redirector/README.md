This disables the [Windows File System Redirector](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384187(v=vs.85\).aspx).

When a 32 bit program runs on a 64 bit operating system the paths to C:/Windows/System32 automatically get redirected to the 32 bit version (C:/Windows/SysWow64), if you really do need to access the contents of System32, you need to disable the file system redirector first.

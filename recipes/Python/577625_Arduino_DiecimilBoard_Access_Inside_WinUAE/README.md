This is one of a few Arduino Python snippets to come your way. This one is DEDICATED entirely to the classic stock
AMIGA A1200HD emulation inside WinUAE. With a small hardware modification it WILL work on a genuine stock AMIGA
A1200HD also see inside the code for more information.

It only requires an ancient version of SATNDARD Python 1.4.x as an absolute minimum, and yes I know it is ancient,
but hey, the classic AMIGA is still capable of running Python to version 2.0.x; other AMIGA variants can run much
newer versions.

Certain assumptions have been made and are inside the code.

Also in the code box is the very basic Test.pde file to program the Arduino Diecimila Board with so that this
works.

There will be Linux and Windows versions coming that require only STANDARD Python also - NO pySerial is required
AT ALL.

Sorry but you will need to split the two pieces of code below manually...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

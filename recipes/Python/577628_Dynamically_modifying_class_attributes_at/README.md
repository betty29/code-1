However considered bad programming, Ruby/JavaScript-like open classes (i.e. classes which can be modified at runtime) actually can be a programming pattern when developing plug-in architectures. And, guess what, Python has that functionality too. This code allows to add attributes (typically methods) to classes, even when already instantiated.

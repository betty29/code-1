This script (or exe if using web2py with """setup(windows=['locker2.py']))""") can be run as a task in windows every x minutes and will test for the presence of an internet connection and depending on whether it is found will set windows to lock after a given timeout without user activity.

This was made with help from random code snippets from around the web.

Tested only on windows 7.

A SAX parser can report contiguous text using multiple characters events.  This is often unexpected and can cause obscure bugs or require complicated adjustments to SAX handlers.  By inserting text_normalize_filter into the SAX handler chain all downstream parsers are ensured that all text nodes in the document Infoset are reported as a single SAX characters event.

This recipe will open a certain URL approximately every 0.5 second using your default browser. It continues to do so until a timeout occurs which has been specified (like the URL) by the user in number of minutes. The timeout starts a reminder that ends once the program has received input. The program then pauses until a key is struck or exits if ESC is pressed.

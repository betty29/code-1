Easy-to-use framework which makes threading almost as simple as normal function calling.

BackgroundCall is a high-level (threading.Thread replacement) concept for non-blocking execution of time consuming functions - yet it focuses naturally on result-returning/conscious termination in a functional style (without imposing an extra Java-style alter ego class layout). It also handles exception (transfer) issues.

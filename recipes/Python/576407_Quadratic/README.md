Quadratic can be used by students for solving quadratic equations ax^2+bx+c a!=0,
which are given by the quadratic formula x = -b + SQUARE-ROOT(b^2-4*a*c)/2*a and x = -b - SQUARE-ROOT(b^2-4*a*c)/2*a
However,if b^2-4*a*c is negative the solutions are not real but complex numbers of the form a+bj.
Though, both real and complex solutions are called using Quadratic

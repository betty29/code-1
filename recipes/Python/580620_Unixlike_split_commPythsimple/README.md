This recipe shows how to create a simple version of the Unix split command in Python. The split command splits an input file into multiple smaller files, the size of each of which is specified by a command-line argument giving the number of lines per file. This is useful for multiple purposes, such as editing large files in pieces, backing up files to small capacity storage devices, sending files across the network, etc.

A simple program to display a PDF (or XPS, EPUB, CBZ) document with forward / backward buttons and a field for directly jumping to a specific page.
It uses the Python binding PyMuPDF for fitz, the high-performance / high-quality graphics library of MuPDF.
It obviously can also be used to display XPS documents on non-Windows platforms.

This new version also supports any links contained in a page.

This program is an extension of recipe 577567 in that it not only allows one to find a directory's size but also remove files based on a context menu. The directory pruner has been used by my roommate to free up room on his hard drive and also by several friends that wished to remove games and other unnecessary program that were taking up their space. Right-click on found directories to review your options.

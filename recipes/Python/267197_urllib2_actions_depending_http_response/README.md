I wanted to touch a particular web page (in order to open/close a database connection inside of Zope) so I came up with this module which uses urllib2 to make the web connection

I was not sure what a 'realm' was, so first I made the HTTPRealmFinder to find out what the realm is.

The HTTPinger calls my required page and acts according to the http return code.

I test reportlab with multiple pythons. Rather than having to install into different virtualenvs I prefer to build my C-extensions in the repository using pythonxx setup.py build_ext and place the repository source folder onto the python path (using eg a link). However, this means I must load the extensions from somewhere other than their natural place. The BuiltExtensionFinder can be used for this.

This is a prime number generator in python that I put together for an article I wrote [How To Find Prime Numbers In Python](http://thelivingpearl.com/2013/01/06/how-to-find-prime-numbers-in-python/)

Please Note. This is only efficient per the article discussing this code in the link above. See comments for a better library to generate prime numbers.

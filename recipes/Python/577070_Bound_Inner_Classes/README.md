This recipe provides the class decorator `BoundInnerClass`.  The decorator makes inner classes symmetric with method calls.  Functions declared inside classes become "methods", and when you call them through an object they automatically get a reference to "self".  The `BoundInnerClass` decorator makes this work for inner classes: an inner class decorated with `BoundInnerClass` gets a reference to that same (now "outer") object passed in automatically to the inner class's `__init__`.

The recipe works unchanged in Python 2.6 and 3.1, and is licensed using the Zlib license.

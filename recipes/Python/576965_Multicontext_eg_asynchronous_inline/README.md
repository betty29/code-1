A framework for executing inline code, contained in a generator, across multiple execution contexts, by pairing it with an executor that handles the context switching at each yield. An example of a generator which executes some iterations synchronously and some asynchronously is provided.  The framework is general enough to be applied to many different coroutine situations.

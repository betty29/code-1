This code is kids level Analogue Data-Logger(/Transient-Recorder), using the Arduino series of dev' boards.

It is no where near completion and is a second feeder/feeler upload only.

It is designed to work from Classic Text Mode Python from Versions 1.4.0 to 2.7.2 on a Classic AMIGA, WinUAE, Linux and Windows, (32 bit), to Vista.
Not tested on Python for Windows 7, (32 bit), nor Mac OSX flavours as I don't have these OSes.

Linux versions run from a default root terminal for the time being.

The Arduino dev' board IS catered for in the code for the above platforms just thoroughly read the code for more information. It defaults to a DEMO mode so you can see it working...

The test code for the Arduino Diecimila Dev Board is here:-

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

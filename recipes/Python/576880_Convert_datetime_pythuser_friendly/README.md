A small contribution to the developer community.

This module caters to the need of developers who                                                                    want to put date & time of post in terms like                                                                
"X days, Y hrs ago", "A hours B mins ago", etc.                                                                         in their applications rather then a basic timestamp                                                           
like "2009-08-15 03:03:00". Additionally it also                                                                
provides since epoch for a given datetime.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                            
It takes in a Python datetime object as an input                                                          
and provides a fancy datetime (as I call it) and                                                               
the seconds since epoch.

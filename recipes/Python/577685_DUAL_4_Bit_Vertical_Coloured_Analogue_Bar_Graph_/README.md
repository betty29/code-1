This is a two channel version of the "Four Bit Vertical Coloured Analogue Bar Graph Generator DEMO...".

These are DUAL LED style "VU" meters in the vertical plane...

This is for standard Python 3.x.x.

It has different overload beeps for each channel, and has all the unwanted code has been removed.

It demonstrates how to obtain multichannel ability, (it is possible to add more channels).

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

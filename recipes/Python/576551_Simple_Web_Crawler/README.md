NOTE: This recipe has been updated with suggested improvements since the last revision.

This is a simple web crawler I wrote to
test websites and links. It will traverse
all links found to any given depth.

See --help for usage.

I'm posting this recipe as this kind of
problem has been asked on the Python
Mailing List a number of times... I
thought I'd share my simple little
implementation based on the standard
library and BeautifulSoup.

This is a fully featured Rss aggregator with parsing included.

It's scalable too very high numbers of feeds and can be used in multi-client environment through web using twisted with a little code on top of Nevow (www.nevow.com), or can easily be integrated inside every app which uses some of the toolkits supported by Twisted.

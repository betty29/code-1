Quick and dirty script to embed unsynchronized lyrics or any other text into MP3 files. The text files with the lyrics are expected to be in the same folder: i.e. for MySong.mp3 the lyrics text should be in the file MySong.txt.

The encoding of the text file will be probed in the following order: 'utf8','iso-8859-1','iso-8859-15','cp1252','cp1251','latin1'. If you need support for more encodings, a list is available at http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/standard-encodings.html

To see the lyrics on an iPod (tested on 6G Classic) you need to press the middle button four times while a song is playing.

The script can also be used to set other ID3 tags. By default SET_OTHER_ID3_TAGS is False so existing ID3 tags will NOT be overwritten.


Usage:
Running the file without arguments will process all MP3 files in the current directory.

Alternatively the path to the folder with MP3's can be passed as the first argument.

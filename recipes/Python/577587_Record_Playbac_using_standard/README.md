This very simple DEMO code records a few seconds of your voice from a microphone, (internal mic' on a laptop), and
replays your voice immedaiately after recording. It goes without saying that the RAW recording can be saved in
any extension of your choice and used as error reporting using the playback method.

There is the possibility of using it as a simple means of a single channel audio oscilloscope using the external
mic input and suitable Python GUI or with simple home built HW a seismometer recorder, plus other ideas.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

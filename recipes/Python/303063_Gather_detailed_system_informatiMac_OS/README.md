This recipe uses the system_profiler application to retrieve detailed information about a Mac OS X system. There are two useful ways to use it: the first is to ask for a complete Python datastructure containing information about the system (see OSXSystemProfiler.all()) and the other is two ask for particular keys in the system information database.

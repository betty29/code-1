The program creates a replica of existing directory structure with specified extension files only. The program maintains the directory-sub-directory architecture while executing. User has to provide two arguments, First the path of existing directory,whose replica has to be created and Second, the path of directory, where the replica has to be created.
This program is developed to fetch files with ".pl" (perl) extension, while maintaining the directory-sub-directory architecture. User can modify it, with his/her interested file extension, like ".txt", ".doc", etc.

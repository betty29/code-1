One liner code to shift each char of a string by some passed value
very simple encryption :)
added version 2 fixing following bugs:
1. Capital chars are shifted correctly.
2. Only alpha numeric chars are shifted.
3. No hard-coded numbers so that as long as first alphabet is 'a'
   and last 'z' it will work :)

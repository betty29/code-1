Needed by recipe 578004, this is meant to be a power pure-python-based module for running optimized 2D vector operations with a few possibilities not seen in most vector libraries. Many of the methods are overloaded to provide great versitility in what operations can be performed. To allow for even greater operations, the many methods mays be wrapped with the included `autocast` method so that even more datatypes can be used in whatever calculations the programmer may desire.

This is an example of the output from recipe 577485 after being formatted for 80 character line width. The file that it generated by the self extracting archiver is a simple PNG image that is only slightly larger than its raw version. By combining adaptive compression with base 64 encoding, the SEA can effectively turn a file into a Python program capable of recreating the original source. Please note that the last instruction in the generated program can only be run on Windows, and any suggestions on using a cross platform alternative would be greatly appreciated.

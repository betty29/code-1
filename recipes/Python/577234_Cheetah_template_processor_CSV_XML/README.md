This script allows to populate Cheetah text templates (http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/) with XML or CSV input data.

This is useful in my day2day work, where I often need to quickly generate bunch of files based on a templates and data.

Cheetah template are very easy to write and understand, and I find it easy to use with CSV or XML data.

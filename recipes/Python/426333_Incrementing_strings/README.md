The story behind this one is that I was building a database conversion utility, converting both schema and data from one database engine to another. Thing was, the target database only allows 10 characters in its table and column names. I stripped down the longer entity names by removing whitespace and spacing characters, then non-leading vowels, and at the last resort, I truncated.

This worked on the whole, but I was getting the occasional duplicate, so I came up with this.

When you write a directory for a group of people, you want it grouped by last name initial and then sorted alphabetically.  This recipe does just that; it creates a dictionary keyed by last name initial with a value  of a tuple of names sorted in alphabetical order.

The input to 'groupnames' should be an iterable that returns strings that contain names written in first-middle-last fashion with each part separated by whitespace.  The resulting names in the grouped dict will have normalized whitespace.

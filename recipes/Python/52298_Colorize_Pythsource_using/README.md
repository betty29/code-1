This code is part of MoinMoin (http://moin.sourceforge.net/) and converts Python source code to HTML markup, rendering comments, keywords, operators, numeric and string literals in different colors.

It shows how to use the built-in keyword, token and tokenize modules to scan Python source code and re-emit it with no changes to its original formatting (which is the hard part).

The test code at the bottom of the module formats itself and launches a browser with the result.

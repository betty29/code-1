After writing a few alarms using `winsound.Beep`, desire to expand into other sound possibilities led to the writing of this program using `winsound.PlaySound`. The sounds are stored in a custom format (some experimentation in archiving files). This is committed for archival to be run under Python 2.5 or later versions.

This is a simple prime number generator in python that I put together for an article I wrote [How To Find Prime Numbers In Python](http://thelivingpearl.com/2013/01/06/how-to-find-prime-numbers-in-python/). In this one we cut the numbers in half so it is only slightly more efficient than the simplest prime number generator. 


Note: There are more efficient ways to do this. Please look at my other recipes.

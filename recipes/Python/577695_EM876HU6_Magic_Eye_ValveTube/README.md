This DEMO displays the action of an EM87 Magic Eye tuning indicator using a standard Python 2.6.x or greater install. It is for at least Windows Vista 32 Bit and at least Debian Linux 6.0.0.

It is for FUN only and shows how to generate yet another analogue display using a default text mode install.

With careful thought and viewing between Code Page 850, (Windows Vista onwards), and Code Page 437, (EFFECTIVELY Linux), one can pick the "graphics" characters to generate some interesting old style text mode displays on screen.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

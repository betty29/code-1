MicroXml provides stand-alone support for the basic, most-used features of XML -- tags, attributes, and element values. It produces a DOM tree of XML nodes. It's compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3. MicroXml does not support DTDs, CDATAs and other advanced XML features.

MicroXml is easy to use and easy to view/navigate its nodes in a debugger. It also includes a minimal XPath-like implementation.

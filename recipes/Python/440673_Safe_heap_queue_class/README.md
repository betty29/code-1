The Heap class is an improvement over a previous recipe (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/437116) that also wraps the heapq module. There are two main differences from the other recipe:
- All methods on this heap preserve the heap property invariant; therefore there is no need for is_heap().
- When creating a new heap, an optional 'key' argument can be specified to determine the comparison key for the items to be pushed into the heap.

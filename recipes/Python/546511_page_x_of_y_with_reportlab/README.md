This approach at the common "page x of y" problem avoids a double pass (creating the pdf document twice).
This is achieved by a customized canvas class which saves the codes into a list instead of creating postscript on pagebreak (showPage). When the document should be saved, we recall each page and draw the pageinfo.
The trick is that you can modify the canvas of each page until it is saved (meaning you already know the total pagecount).

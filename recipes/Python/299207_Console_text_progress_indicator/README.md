I was finding that I needed a progress indicator for Linux and Windows console applications that could be used to show the user that work was progressing and how much of the total work that had been completed.  I finally broke down and wrote this class that seems to do exactly what I wanted.  Since I continue to see questions about how to write such a class on Comp.Lang.Python, I thought I'd donate it to this Cookbook archive.

Fast lightweight attribute style access to list. I think this is closest to mutable C struct type.

Same as collections.namedtuple but subclasses list, so fields may be modified.
Same as popular Record class but smaller and faster. http://code.activestate.com/recipes/502237-simple-record-aka-struct-type/

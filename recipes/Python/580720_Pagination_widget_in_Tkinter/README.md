I added here a pagination widget in tkinter with different styles.

When this option *"hide_controls_at_edge"* is true, the widget hides *"next"*, *"previous"*, *"last"* and *"first"* buttons when they are not necessary. For example when pagination is at the first page then the buttons *"previous"* and *"first"* are not strictly necessary. Analogously when pagination is at the last page, the buttons *"last"* and *"next"* are not necessary because its not possible to go more forward.


The user can customize the text of *"next"*, *"previous"*, *"last"* and *"first"* buttons. When some of these options is None, then the corresponding button is not showed: *prev_button*. *next_button*, *first_button*, *last_button*

The *"command"* option is a callback called every time a page is selected.

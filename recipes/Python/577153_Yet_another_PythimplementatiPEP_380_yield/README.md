Any Python programmer knows how extremely powerful [generators](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/) are. Now (since version 2.5) Python generators can not only yield values but also receive them, so they can be used to build [coroutines](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/).

One drawback of the current implementation of generators is that you can only yield/receive values to/from the immediate caller. That means, basically, that you cannot easily refactor your code and write nested generators. [PEP-380](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/) is the most serious effort to overcome this issue, but until it gets approved we can still play around with pure Python implementations of *yield from*. 

This recipe follows terminology used by others in the past ([recipe566726](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576727), [recipe576728](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576728)), but I've tried to simplify  the code as much as possible.

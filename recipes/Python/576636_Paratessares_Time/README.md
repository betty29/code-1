This module provides several functions that covert earth seconds into paratessares time. It is used to implement time keeping on a fictional planet and is the standard time system of Tessaressunago. It can be used as an inspiration to other people creating their own units of time or as partitioned timestamps that can be applied to records. There are four different modules listed below: the standard implementation, a unit test, and two examples. To see the Python 2.5 version of this code in action and to test out its functionality, you can go over to the Utility Mill and find Paratessares_Time in the library ( http://utilitymill.com/utility/Paratessares_Time ).

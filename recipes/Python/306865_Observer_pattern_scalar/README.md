This recipe uses descriptors of new style classes to implement the observer pattern. This implementation supports exactly one observer (no one-many relation).

This recipe builds on recipe http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/306864. It assumes that the text of the recipe is stored as "list_dict_observer.py".

Presented here are two modules, "html_help" & "Zam".
Both modules contain two classes.

"html_help" contains "html_table" and "html_month".
A html_table produces tables with a readable format.
A html_month is just a logical extention of the html_table.

"Zam" contains "array" and "matrix".
An array is 1D list with fixed sized and mutable internals.
A matrix is the same except for the fact that it is 2D.

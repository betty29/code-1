Easy to use chain of dictionaries for crafting nested scopes or for a tree of scopes.  Useful for analyzing AST nodes, XML nodes or other structures with multiple scopes.  Can emulate various chaining styles including static/lexical scoping, dynamic scoping and Python's own globals(), locals(), nested scopes, and writeable nonlocals.  Can also model Python's inheritance chains: instance dictionary, class dictionary, and base classes.

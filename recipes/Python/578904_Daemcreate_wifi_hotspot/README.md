This recipe is based on Hotspotd, a small linux daemon to create a wifi hotspot on linux. It depends on hostapd for AP provisioning and dnsmasq to assign IP addresses to devices.

Hotspotd works by creating a virtual NAT (Network address transation) table between your connected device and the internet using iptables.

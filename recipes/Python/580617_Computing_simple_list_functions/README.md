This recipe shows how to compute some simple list functions (functions that operate on lists) using simple recursive algorithms. Simple non-recursive algorithms exist for these tasks; this recipe is just for illustrative  purposes. However, the principles described can be used for more complex recursive algorithms, for which non-recursive algorithms might be more complex than the recursive ones.

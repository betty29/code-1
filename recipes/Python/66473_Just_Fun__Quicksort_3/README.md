OK, 4 lines if you count wrapped lines.  :^)  This is a rather naive implementation of quicksort that illustrates the expressive power of list comprehensions.  DO NOT USE THIS IN REAL CODE!

NOTE: Due to an annoyance in the ASPN submission filters you must manually remove the space after the '\' character in the third line if you intend to use the code.  Otherwise you will get a syntax error.

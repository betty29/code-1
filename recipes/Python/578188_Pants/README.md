According to memory this is a port of a shell script called pants that allows one to "start," "stop," "restart," and find the "status" of one's pants (the program itself). I am not sure what the silliness is about but must have found the idea interesting to rewrite in Python. This is committed for archival to be run under Python 2.5 or later versions.

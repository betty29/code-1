"execfile()" IS BACK!!!

Some example lines to add to any test code you write that work from Python (1.4.0), 2.0.1 to 3.2.2
on various platforms.

It is all Public Domain and you can do with it as you please...

I really don't care how you vote and/or rate this as I try to write Python code for my
usage to work on the platforms and versions inside the code.

These are a little tongue in cheek so don't take them too seriously.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...

(Watch out for wordwrapping, etc...)

This will probably be the last one of these uploads as the last one did not "take off".

Bazza, G0LCU...

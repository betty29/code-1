Managing ref-counting is a complex and error prone business. If you choose C++ to extend or embed Python, you can simply use a modification on std::auto_ptr. Instead of calling delete on the managed pointer, it will decref it.

So now you can do:

auto_py str = PyStr_FromString("Hello World!");

and forget about having to decref it altogether! Just like auto_ptr you can get the PyObject * with get(), release it from managed control with release(), and rebind it with reset(new_ptr). You can also incref it by calling inc(), but be cautious as you can easily create a leak by increfing once to much.

This recipe adapts the infix operator trick from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/384122-infix-operators/ to give the appropriate behavior with numpy arrays, so you can write A \*dot\* B for np.dot(A,B)

UPDATE
A solution to the dot problem was recently added to the numpy trunk: the dot method was added to the ndarray class so you can write a.dot(b). See http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1456

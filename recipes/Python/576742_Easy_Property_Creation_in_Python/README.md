Presented in this recipe is a function **prop**, with that a property *myprop* can be created as simple as:

    @prop
    def myprop(): pass

It has only 7 lines of code, easy to understand, easy to customize, will make the code look much netter and will save you a lot of typing.
 
See discussion and the doc test string for more complicated usages.

Note: This is a recipe created with python v.2.5.2.

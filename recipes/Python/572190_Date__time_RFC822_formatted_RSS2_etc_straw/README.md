I live in a geographical area whose daylight savings time provisions seem to fool software. I would therefore like to avoid mentioning time zone when I create a timestamp in RFC822 format. I have looked for but could not find an elegant way of expressing what I want. In hopes that someone will see this and be aghast at my ignorance, then provide something nice, I humbly offer the following.

It takes a datetime and gives back an RFC822 timestamp (I think).

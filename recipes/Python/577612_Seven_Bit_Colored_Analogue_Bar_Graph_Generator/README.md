..For STANDARD Python 2.6 and above...

This code will display a horizontal full colour analogue "VU" style meter. It displays green for normal, yellow
for warning and red for danger with a critical error beep near the end of full scale, at value 120+.

This version is for Python 2.6 and above and only for the Linux, (*nix?), platform.

It is an "at a glance" display that is in colour rather than having to read say a digitally generated number.

A Python 3.x version can be found here:-

This has uses "for at a glance" voltmeters, ammeters, data-loggers, anemometers etc, etc...

Watch for wordwrapping etc...

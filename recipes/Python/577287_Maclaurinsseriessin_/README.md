C. Maclaurin. A Scottish mathematician gained his master degree at age 17, and his major mathematics' work arise from his special knowledge in Newton's ideas and the formulation of Newton's methods.

However, C. Maclaurin also contributed to the astronomy science and helped to improve maps and invented some mechanical devices.

My mathematics python's programs is a set of Maclaurin's series to compute some of the most important functions in calculus.

Though, the computation of an infinite sum which give the value of a function in terms of the derivatives evaluated at a special case where x0 = 0,in contrast with Taylor series. 

It is assumed that the angle is expressed in radian while using the Maclaurin's series to approximate  the trigonometric functions sine and cosine, thus, converting the angle into degrees in my program could be useful for students who prefer using degrees.

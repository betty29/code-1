As any twisted user knows, the original python subprocess module can yield to interferences with twisted's own reactor - at least unless installSignalHandlers is false, which can lead to other consequences. 

This recipe simulates a stripped down version of subprocess.check_output() which returns a deferred and is twisted friendly.

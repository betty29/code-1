A simple integration of a CherryPy web server, using Quixote template publishing, managed in its own thread.

Using CherryPy as a web server is a good move because it fixes problems on Windows shutting down a call to serve_forever.  This example extends the CherryPy capability by running it in a seperate thread.  Further extension comes from Quixote, for templating HTML.

One thing I like about this snippet of code is its simplicity.  And the fact that it solves a large number of design problems, all in one shot.

This one line function adds up the ascii values of a string and returns the total as a checksum.  Also included is a variation which returns the checksum mod 256 (so it can be used as a single byte).
The same technique can be used to add up a list of numbers, or to return the average of a list (examples are also included) or to do any other any other simple processing on a list or a string.

There're quite a few python ORM's. However, most are not easy to use.  In Ruby on Rails's ActiveRecord ORM, you don't have to define schema, just specify the relationship like "belongs_to" and "has_many", and ORM do rest of the work, it's very easy to learn and easy to use.
This recipe provide a python ORM that behave like ActiveRecord.

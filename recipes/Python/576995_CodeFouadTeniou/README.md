Code_Fouad_Teniou program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text by using a key ( made_key).
However, the key is a set of numbers selected at random and the program allows you to create an infinity numbers of this key, which make the code impossible to crack.
Though, I used a metaclass to access the methods used in my program to allow permutation of such methods in a way to perform desirable tasks and in a specific order to suit the  need of the programmerâ€™s outcome.

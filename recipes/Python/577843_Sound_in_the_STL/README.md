I get to use a number of languages and have found Python lacks good sound implementation in it's STL. Sure you can download a module, but many organisations make it difficult to install add ons, and when you hand apps to people you don't want to have to say, first install python, then install x, y, z from these websites. The STL needs to have a module added in that handles sound cross platform. I have noticed people are happy with PyGame. Perhaps adding that to the STL would be good for everybody?

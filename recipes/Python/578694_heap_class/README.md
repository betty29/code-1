*heapq* is a nice python module, but the interface is not so clean. I found a one-liner on this [blog](http://metapython.blogspot.de/2010/10/creating-heap-class-in-one-python-line.html), it's as short as possible, but not really pythonic either :) Here is my contribution to a most readable heap class.

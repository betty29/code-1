As one accumulates multiple drives, hard and flash, containing,
thousands even millions of files, it becomes useful to have a text file
containing an alphabetized catalog list of all files and their locations 
by drive and directory.

The list can be searched by eye or by an editor to locate particular
files.

The list can also be loaded into a script to be filtered 
programmatically as desired.

 a better better command line calculator,

 put this in a file, run it, cut and past a bunch of numbers (don't
 worry about the $ signs and commas) hit enter and it adds them up
 use / * -  + like normal

 added features over just using python as a command line calculator:

   * numbers can include ,s and $s or anything really and it still works
     this allows you to cut and paste things like $1,123.65 and it still works
   * add by default! (unless you run with -x)
     cut and paste a bunch of numbers hit enter and it'll add them all up
   * command line history and readline, up arrow recalls your history
     even between sessions
   * _ is the last answer, just like in python

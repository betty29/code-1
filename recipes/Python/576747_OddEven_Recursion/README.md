Odd-Even Recursion program is a recursive function, which does produce a positive or a negative set of odd or even numbers. However, the function return numbers which are lower or greater than the value of the number entered by the user until it reaches its base case value, where the function returns a value and the recursion stops. Though solving repetitive problems requires a powerful method and yet recursion allows the design of faster recursive algorithms. Recursion method could be used to solve higher-level mathematics' problems, such as sequences and it is a branch in the computer science study.

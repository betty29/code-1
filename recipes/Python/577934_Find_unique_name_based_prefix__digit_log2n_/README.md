Find a unique name based on a prefix for a content in a container
(eg. a file in a directory) adding a digit to the name

Does it in log2(n) + log2(n/2) were n is the number of duplicates

This would be used eg. in a CMSÂ giving identifiers based on content title, or when shortening file names on a file system, etc.

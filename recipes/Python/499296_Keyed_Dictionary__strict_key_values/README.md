The KeyedDict object keeps a list of approved key values.  If you try to assigned an unapproved key to a value, an exception is thrown.

When you create the object, you give it a sequence (tuple, list, etc.) of key objects and then, when you set an item with a key, it will make sure that the key is in the "approved" list.  If you try to set an item with a key that isn't in your approved list, you get an TypeError exception.

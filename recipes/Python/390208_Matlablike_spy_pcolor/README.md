I really like the 'spy' and 'pcolor' functions, which are useful in viewing matrices. 'spy' prints colored blocks for values that are above a threshold, and 'pcolor' prints out each element in a continuous range of colors.
The attached is a little Python/PIL script that does these functions for Numpy arrays.

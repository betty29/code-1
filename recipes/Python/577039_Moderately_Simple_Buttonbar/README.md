This buttonbar program is similar to my ButtonBarV1 recipe 577038 except a file pattern such as c:\source\python\new\*.py can be entered instead of a single file.  This will allow you to scroll through a list of matching files selecting the files you want to process.  You must still select the command separately for each file.  Besides the file pattern or file a menu file and an optional list of section names are specified on the command line.

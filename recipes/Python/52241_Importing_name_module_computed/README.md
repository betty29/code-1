This function allows you to do "from module import name", where both "module" and "name" are dynamic values (i.e. expressions or variables). For example, this can be used to implement a "plugin" mechanism to extend an application by external modules that adhere to some common interface.

This pattern is used in MoinMoin (http://moin.sourceforge.net/) to load extensions implementing variations of a common interface, like "action", "macro", and "formatter".

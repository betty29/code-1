This small recipe enables truth value testing on iterables.

It is quite common to do things like:

    if somesequence:
        ...
    else:
        ...

Such constructs, that enter the if block if the sequence's got one or more elements and the else block if it's empty, work fine on non-lazy builtin sequences (lists, strings, tuples) and dictionaries as well, but doesn't necessarily work on generic iterables -  most of them are always true regardless of their contents, since they're some kind of object. A classical example is generators, but such behaviour can be extended to any object implementing the Iterable interface.

Just wrap your iterable with this decorator and you'll get a truth-aware iterable which supports proper truth testing by doing a small first element prefetching and can then be used just like the original iterable.

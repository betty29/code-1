This is not a hexreader. This code creates a raw hexdump of a binary file that is whitespace, optional, delimited. The dump is saved into the current directory with a ".hex" extension.

It works on just about any current platform but is designed around a stock Amiga A1200(HD) with Python 1.4.0. It also works on the current stable version 3.5.2.

I needed a hexdump some years ago for banging the Amiga hardware, and decided to modify recently for another usage but it had to still work on version 1.4.0 for the classic A1200.

Enjoy...

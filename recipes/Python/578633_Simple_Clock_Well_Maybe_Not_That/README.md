Remember this?

Well the Python version of the top URL has been uploaded to AMINET on 01-08-2013...

Now the big gun that complained about my fun Python upload and voted it down can see
that this was a serious attempt ae viewing "Hello World!" in extra large xharacters.

This is the result in Python...

It is ONLY uploaded to AMINET and that is where it will stay.

If you want it then use the pointer inside code section.

Remember to change the BIG_TIME.py.txt file on AMINET to BIG_TIME.py...

Designed around a Macbook Pro OSX 10.7.5 for the Classic AMIGA platforms and works
on Debian 6.0.x and PCLiuxOS 2009 using Python versions 1.4.0 to 3.3.2 inclusive...

Although the description in the AMINET readme below is for an AMIGA environment it does
not take a genius to adapt it to the other platforms...

Boy was this difficult to get working in a single Python script...

ENJOY...

This is the AMINET readme file:-

Short:        A Big Digital Clock Python Script.
Author:       wisecracker@tesco.net (Barry Walker)
Uploader:     wisecracker@tesco.net (Barry Walker)
Type:         dev/src
Version:      1.00.00
Architecture: generic; m68k-amigaos

Distribution: Public Domain, Emailware.

============================================================================

Architectures: Classic AMIGAs, E-UAE and WinUAE.
------------------------------------------------

  MINIMUM Requirements Are:-
  --------------------------

        68EC020 CPU and 2MB RAM total, example, a standard A1200(HD).
        WinUAE Version 1.5.3 minimum. 
        Standard OS3.0x install or better.
        Python Version 1.4.0 or higher.
        (Also, OSX 10.7.5, Debian Linux 6.0.x and PCLinuxOS 2009.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

History.
--------

01-08-2013.
Version 1.00.00:- Original upload to AMINET...

This is dedicated entirely to the AMIGA community and AMINET and will not
be uploaded elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install just download the "BIG_TIME.py.txt" file and rename it to
"BIG_TIME.py" without the quotes. Drag this file into your AMIGA PYTHON:
volume and...

From a minimum of Python Version 1.4.0 prompt:-

>>> exec(open("PYTHON:BIG_TIME.py").read())<CR>

And away you go...

This code is/was designed to work in all versions of Python from 1.4.0
to 3.3.2 on at least the platforms shown in the Architectures: section.

It was developed entirely on a Macbook Pro OSX 10.7.5 and finalised using
MEmacs for the AMIGA.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a simple DEMO to show how to generate large digits in Python
and put them to use as an _AT_A_GLANCE_ digital clock.

It starts up by generating all of the characters available for the DEMO
for five seconds then goes into the clock proper.

As this code is multi platform AND multi Python version then it is issued
as GPL2...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    All WinUAE, E-UAE and Classic AMIGA test conditions were/are running
    standard OS3.0x/OS3.1x and using standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what strange configuration setups will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.

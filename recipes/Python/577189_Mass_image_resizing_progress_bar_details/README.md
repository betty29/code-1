This script uses the Python Imaging libraries to resize images in a folder and its sub-folders iteratively. The details like the directory hierarchy, current progress etc are displayed dynamically. We can optionally specify more image formats, required size etc.(See command-line argument --help).
This is meant for processing large collections of images, which justifies the display of many details.

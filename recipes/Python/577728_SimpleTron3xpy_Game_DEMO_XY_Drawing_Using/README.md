SimpleTron3x.py.

This code is a FUN program only to DEMO how to draw in a text mode Python shell.

There is an inkey() "function" extracted from a "class" recipe on this site.
See code for more information.

This was tested on PCLinuxOS 2009 with Python 3.0.x and Debian 6.0.0 with Python 3.1.x.

This ASSUMES an 80 x 24 Python shell window.

Issued as Public Domain, you may do as you like with this code.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.

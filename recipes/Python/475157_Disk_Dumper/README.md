This recipe will display a hex dump of the disk specified on the command line. As the last two arguments, the program takes the first sector and last sector that should be displayed by this utility. The size of the sectors is stored in a variable created right after the imports executed by this script. The main feature of this recipe is its cross OS capabilities as demonstrated in get_data.

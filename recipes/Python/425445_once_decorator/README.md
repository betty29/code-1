This decorator runs a function or method once and caches the result.

It offers minimal memory use and high speed (only one extra function call). It is _not_ a memoization implementation, the result is cached for all future arguments as well.

This code is used in the TestOOB testing framework (http://testoob.sourceforge.net).

See the recipe [here](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577878) for a description of the problem.

This variant allows the user to choose between two APIs, either by supplying the count, start value and end value:

    >>> list(spread(5, 1.0, end=2.0))
    [1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8]

or the count, start value and step size:

    >>> list(spread(5, 1.0, step=-0.25))
    [1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0]

As before, the count argument specifies how many subdivisions are made. The optional argument `mode` selects whether the start and end values are included. By default, start is included and end is not, and exactly count values are returned.

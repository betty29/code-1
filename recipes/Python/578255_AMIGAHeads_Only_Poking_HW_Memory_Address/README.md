For AMIGA-Heads Only...

This code is purely for a minimum of a stock Classic AMIGA A1200(HD), E-UAE, and WinUAE running AMIGA OS3.0x to 3.1x.
It will NOT work on any other platform!

(It MIGHT work on AMIGA OS3.5x and 3.9x with Python 2.4.6, but totally untested and I hold no responsibility for the outcome when trying it.)

It is a DEMO to poke a byte inside _ANY_ memory address inside the standard CPU 68EC020 16MB boundary.

This is not a function nor a class but just a DEMO to show how to write directly to HW, (or memory), addresses.

POKING memory or hardware addresses is not recommended for novices without studying the machine first, and, this code will ignore any _ENFORCER_hits_.

I experimented with this several years ago and have decided to finally release it. I do await the flak!

It works from Python Versions 1.4.0 to 2.0.1 for the classic AMIGA.

This is issued as Public Domain and you may do with it as you please.

Ensure that the T: Volume exists on the running machine.

See inside the code and text below it also as to how it works...

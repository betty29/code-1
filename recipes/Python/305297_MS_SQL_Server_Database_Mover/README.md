A script to automate the movement of databases from one Microsoft SQL Server to another. Designed to detach, copy, and reattach database files with a single call. Used to move databases with a minimum of downtime.

Process contains examples of Windows Cluster detection, and the querying of physical database characteristics and operations (default directories, list of files comprising database, detach/attach, login/SID matching).

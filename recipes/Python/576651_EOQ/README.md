Economic order quantity (EOQ) model is used in stock control by many companies rather than other stock control systems such as the Just-in-Time model.
Though, ACCA’s students will benefit from this program while preparing their ACCA course and exam in financial management towards their ACCA professional qualification, yet financial management professionals already holding posts within companies using this system will be able to compare different sets of item quantities and rates to reduce their company’s total cost of holding and ordering such items.

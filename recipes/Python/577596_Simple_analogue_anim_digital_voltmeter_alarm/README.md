I needed a simple standard Python analogue and digital display along with an overload beep when used as a
basic voltmeter.

Analogue readout, for quick glance.
Digital readout, for better accuracy.
Beep, to warn me of impending doom... ;o)

This was my starter code and works from Python 1.4.x to 2.7.x on MINIMUM platforms, AMIGA A1200, MS Windows ME
and Knoppix 5.1.1. It is a stand alone program and the easiest way to start it is to import it as though it is
a module.

(I DO have a Python 3.x.x version too and WILL be uploaded here in the future.)

Although this is a DEMO it did access, (home built), HW from various ports on differing platforms.

This module IS needed for it to work:-

These simple HW access modes using standard Python code WILL be released in the future.

This DEMO is released as Public Domain and you may modify it as you please...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

This recipe has a similar objective to http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/473899, but was not derived from it. This recipe was written before the aforementioned recipe was submitted to this Cookbook. The purpose of this demo is to illustrate showing the status of an operation to a user in an ASCII environment.

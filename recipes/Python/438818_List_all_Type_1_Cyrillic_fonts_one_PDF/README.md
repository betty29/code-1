This example uses ReportLab PDF library <http://www.reportlab.com> and made
from reportlab/demos/stdfonts/stdfonts.py demo. It generates tables showing
all Type 1 fonts in Cyrillic cp1251 encoding in /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1
Linux directory. It may be helpful for choosing most suitable fonts for your
documents.

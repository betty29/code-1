This recipe comes from an idea to "improve" Tim Delaney's "autosuper" recipe (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/286195) by using a similar approach but with no need to inherit a class from 'autosuper'. It is now a free function to be used inside a method body whithout the need to pass it the 'self' object:
class C(object):
   def foo(self,*a,**k):
      # do something
      autosuper(*a,**k)
      # do something

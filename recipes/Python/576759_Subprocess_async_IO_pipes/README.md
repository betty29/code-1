Just stumbled upon the need to move data chunks between subprocesses in a non-linear way with some logic in-between, so tee(1) and fifo(7)'s weren't too good option.
Inspired by 440554, but rewritten from scratch to remove unnecessary delays due to sleep(3) calls and suboptimal try/sleep-based polling.

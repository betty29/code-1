This is a simple base class that can be used to quickly get connected to any database that has DAO interface.  I've used it quite a lot with MS Access databases and it has worked quite well for me.  It really is just a Python wrapper around the DAO COM object.  Hasn't been tested extensively, but worked in the projects that I've used it in so far.

This code implements a cache (CacheHandler) and a throttling mechanism (ThrottlingProcessor) for urllib2. By using them, you can ensure that subsequent GET requests for the same URL returns a cached copy instead of causing a roundtrip to the remote server, and/or that subsequent requests to a server are paused for a couple of seconds to avoid overloading it. The test code at the end explains all there is to it.

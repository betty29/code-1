***Is it possible to create a simple command line program that I can use to quickly test my regular expressions?***

Yes it is. This simple regular expression tester uses Python's re module as well as others to quickly allow you to test your regular expression in one go.

TODO:

* Add Support For Multiple Regular Expression Input

Recent Changes:

* Made the output prettier with a little more whitespace. More bytes, but at least it's easier to read!

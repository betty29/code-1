I have a program, say a debugger, that runs another program which has options of its own. I want people to be able to give options to either program and don't want them to get confused. For example, perhaps both have "--help" options.

So to be a little more concrete, let's say I'd like to run say program (pdb) and have it pass "--help" to a program I want it to run (specified as a command argument) called "debugged-script". I'd like to issue the command like this:

pdb --trace debugged-script --help

and have "--help" go to "debugged-script" and not "pdb".

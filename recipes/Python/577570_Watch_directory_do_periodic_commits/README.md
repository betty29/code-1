You run this script with directory as parameter (defaults to current directory) and scripts watch this directory for changes in files - creating new file, deleting some file and modification to any file. All these changes are periodically commited to subversion repository using external commands.

Not especially good for coding but great for tracking changes in your text files f.e. during essay writing etc.

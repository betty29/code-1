This recipe provides a mini-framework for creating custom Postscript PS and PDF files from scratch. It includes sample code for a personalized business index card.

Recipe does not use any Python PDF libraries. However, Ghostscript and a PDF viewer are useful for displaying/debugging output.

It's easier than you might think to roll your own Postscript code!

I once tried to give Python something like C's enums, as described
here: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=G6qzLy.6Fo%40world.std.com
That approach tried to assign to a dictionary returned by the locals()
function, intending that such assignments would become class attributes.
The Tim-bot explained to me the errors of my ways. The quest for the
perfect Python enum goes on.

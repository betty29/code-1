Python does not have lazy evaluation syntax features built-in, but fortunately decorators can be used with new-style classes to emulate such a feature. There are cases where one wants ``foo.property`` to return the actual property whose calculation takes significant amount of time.

This recipe adapts the existing `property` to provide a `lazypropery` decorator that does this.

See the first comment below for an example usage.

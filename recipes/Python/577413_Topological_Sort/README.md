Given items that depend on other items, a topological sort arranges  items in order that no one item precedes an item it depends on.
In this example items are strings and dependencies are expressed in a dictionary whose keys are items and whose values are a set of dependent items. Note that the dict may contain self-dependencies (which are ignored), and dependent items that are not also dict keys, such as the item 'ieee'.

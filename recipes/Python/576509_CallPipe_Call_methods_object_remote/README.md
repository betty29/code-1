I am process A and I own object Obj. Now I decide to fork(): process B is born.

How do I do to make process B call the methods of A's object Obj (and not the methods of its own copy of Obj...) ?

This is what this module does: you create the "CallPipe" for Obj prior to fork()ing, and then process B can call any method of A's object Obj through it.

*run_with_reloader:* Binding some hotkeys, for example control-r and control-R, the application is reloaded. It's the same behaviour than a browser. This code is useful for debugging.

Some applications use a similar approach for easy development. For example flask and django reloads the application every time they observe a change in a file.

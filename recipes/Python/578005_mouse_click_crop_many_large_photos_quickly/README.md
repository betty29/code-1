Waste no mouse clicks making multiple crops on many image files.  Through pygame interface with pan, zoom and next/previous image.  Saves files at new resolution and serialized names in a seperate folder.  the mainloop() and helper functions are easy to reuse, but I include a cruddy text based interface if needed.  if not, comment out most of __main__().

Requires PIL (python imaging library) and pygame.

Some example lines to add to any test code you write that work from Python 1.4.0 to 3.2.2 on various platforms.
It is all Public Domain and you can do with it as you please...

This is to go alongside this little snippet...
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577836-raw_input-for-all-versions-of-python/?in=lang-python

I really don't care how you vote and/or rate this as I try to write Python code for my usage
to work on the platforms and versions inside the code.

Some people will know this but MANY won't and there will be more to come that involve platform
and version compatibility...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...

(Watch out for wordwrapping, etc...)

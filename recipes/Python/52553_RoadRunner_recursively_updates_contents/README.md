This recipe allows you to update desired files in a directory tree. It needs to be run from the shell. Once you run it, it will ask you for: a) the "string" you want to insert in the file b) the extension of the files to update e.g: .html c) a regular expresion ( where you want the string to be inserted ) and d) the path of the directory where you want this update to occur.

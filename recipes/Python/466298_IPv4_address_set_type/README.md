Building on another recipe of mine (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/466286) this is a set type for storing IPv4 address(-ranges) efficiently. It parses several different formats for specifying IPv4 address ranges described in the docstrings, and allows you to output the contained addresses as ip/mask or ip-ip pairs, and also allows you to iterate over all ip addresses.

The behaviour of the mouse wheel is similar to the one on Windows.

I tested this program on Windows 7 and on Linux Mint 17. Please let me know if this code doesn't work on your platform. I will appreciate any comments.

This is a practical application of this recipe: a scrolling frame with mouse wheel support.

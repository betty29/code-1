After wrestling and wrestling with Outlook 2000 to turn *off* HTML mail, I had to figure out how to send HTML from Python for a recent project.  Oh the irony, the irony.

It's good policy (and trivially easy) to embed two versions of your message if you're planning on sending HTML mail:  the HTML version, and a text-only version.  Lots of folks still prefer their character-mode MUAs (viva Mutt!) so don't go alienating them by sending them something that they can't read.

The e-mails generated by this code have been tested on and render correctly with Outlook 2000, Eudora 4.2, Hotmail, and Netscape Mail.  It's likely that they will work in other HTML-capable MUAs as well.

Some of Python's powerful meta-programming features are used to enable writing Python functions which include Prolog-like statements. Such functions load a Prolog-like database. When coupled with a suitable inference engine for logic databases, this is a way to add logical programming -- the last unsupported major paradigm -- to Python. Start at the bottom of the code for an example of the enabled syntax.

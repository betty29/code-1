A small script that allows you to push files and directories to S3 using a context menu in nautilus file browser.

Add this script to ``~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/`` and be sure it is executable.  Requires [boto](http://boto.readthedocs.org/), the python aws library.  Credentials by default are looked up from ~/.boto but can be supplied in the get_s3_conn() function.

BigDirs locates directories taking up the most disk space in files at that directory level, not in the nested directories below it. In my experience this is the easiest way to find where my disk space got chewed up.

Set DEFAULT_DIR for the root directory you wish to check.
Set DEFAULT_THRESHOLD for the minimum size of the directories you wish to see in the output.

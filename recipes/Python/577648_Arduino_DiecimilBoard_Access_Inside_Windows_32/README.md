Finally the Windows 32 bit version of the other recipes of similar design.
(The AMIGA/WinUAE and Linux versions are already on this site.)

To get more recognisable characters displayed it is best to use a potentiometer wired as one end to +5V, the
other end to Gnd and the wiper to ANALOG IN 0. This has been tested on various Linux Distros and kept as
simple as possible so that anyone can understand it.

The required ?.pde file for the Arduino Board can be found here:-

Similar assumptions are made as in the URL above.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

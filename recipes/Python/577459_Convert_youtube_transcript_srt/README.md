A quick and dirty script to convert youtube's transcripts (xml format) to .srt subtitle files.

To download youtube's transcript, use this url: http://video.google.com/timedtext?lang=en&v=VIDEO_ID (replace "VIDEO_ID" by the ID which is in the video URL).

You can easily use this converter in a script which could download the transcript by importing it and then call the main function.

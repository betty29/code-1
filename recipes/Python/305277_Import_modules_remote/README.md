Storing modules in a central location, which are used by remote, seperate clients has obvious benefits. This recipe describes a method by which modules can be fetched from a remote server and compiled into bytecode modules which are used by the client.

The recipe has 3 sections (server.py, client.py, test.py) which need to be copied into 3 files.

Encryption.Using your solution to the previous problem, and create a "rot13" translator.
"rot13" is an old and fairly simplistic encryption routine where by each letter of the alphabet is
rotated 13 characters. Letters in the first half of the alphabet will be rotated to the equivalent
letter in the second half and vice versa, retaining case. For example, 'a' goes to 'n' and 'X' goes
to 'K'. Obviously, numbers and symbols are immune from translation.

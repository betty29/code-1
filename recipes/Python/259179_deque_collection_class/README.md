Pure python drop in replacement for collections.deque() from Py2.4.  See documentation at:  http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/lib/module-collections.html
<br>
Uses a dictionary as the underlying data structure for the deque (pronounced "deck", short for "double-ended queue", a generalization of stacks and queues) which provides O(1) performance for appends and pops from either end.
<br>
Runs on PyPy, Jython, and older Pythons.

A table driven routine generates a unit conversion module and a doctest file. The generated module uses the Decimal class to create unit conversion classes which uses class properties to perform the conversion. conversion.py supplies the following classes:
    Distance
    Area
    Volumn
    Time
    Velocity
    Acceleration
    Mass
    Force
    Weight
    Pressure
    Frequency
    Power
    Temperature

New classes and additional units can easily be created by adding to the table.

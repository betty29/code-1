The following program was written to understand how two different color systems related to each other, RGB and HSV. The recipe could be better written and extended further to support other color systems in addition to the two it already uses, but it is a simple example of how one might go about to understand what others speak of when talking about color. The GUI is simple to use and responsive, and the code is a good demonstration of what may need to be written to produce a demonstration such as this one.

This code queries the Northwind Database's "Order Details" Table..Make sure the path of the DB is correct and the query u are using is also accurate cause this does not give any error outputs but writes it in Apache's error.log file...
copy this file in the cgi-bin directory and call it from the web browser as http://localhost/cgi-bin/ADO.py (file name). The only problem is the currency field, I cannot obtain the currency field properly it is obtained as a tuple !! hope u can help me ! :)

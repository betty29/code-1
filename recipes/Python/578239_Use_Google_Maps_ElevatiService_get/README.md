The Google Maps Elevation Service provides a simple interface for getting elevation data for any location on Earth, including locations under the sea (where the elevation is negative). 

The following function is based on the examples presented in the Elevation API web page: `https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/`.

Before using the Elevation Service you must read the rather strict usage limits set by Google in the above web page, especially the term that stipulates that "the Elevation API may only be used in conjunction with displaying results on a Google map; using elevation data without displaying a map for which elevation data was requested is prohibited."

When creating a class, we often end up writing lots get/set methods which essentially do the same thing e.g. get_name, get_age, ... , set_name, set_age, ...
- each such method will simply set or return the value of its associated attribute.

This recipe is a stategy for automating the creation of such simple get/set methods and exposing them as properties.

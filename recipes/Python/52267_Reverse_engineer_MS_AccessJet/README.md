Reads the structure of a Jet (Microsoft Access .MDB) database file, and creates the SQL DDL necessary to recreate the structure.

Originally written to aid in migrating Jet databases to larger RDBMS systems, through E/R design tools, when the supplied "import" routines missed objects like indexes and FKs.

A first experiment in Python, that became an often used tool.

This module was inspired by http://processing.org/ . The code is meant to mimic an extremely small subset of this high-performance library. After seeing how easy it was to accomplish certain task in the Java framework, a desire was created to have a simple starting point to create little graphical experiments that would be easy to program without haveing to know a lot of details regarding setup, timing, et cetera. This is the result of that desire.

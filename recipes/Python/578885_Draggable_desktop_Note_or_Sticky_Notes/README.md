Inspired by "A-Note": http://a-note.sourceforge.net/

And based on these tricks:

But here I am using my improved version of the automatic resized Text widget:

Features:
- The note is draggable
- You can minimize the note at the left side of the screen or maximize it
- You can hide the contents of the note
- Hotkeys to save content of note to a file, open content of file inside a note and show help.

Please, comment me whether you see some bug.

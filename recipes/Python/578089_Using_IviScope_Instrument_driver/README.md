This recipe shows how to use the IVI-COM interface of a scope. The example is based on a Tektronix scope using the tkdpo2k3k4k driver. Two examples are given : the first using the IviScope interface (limited interface to the scope, but with full compatibility) and the Tkdpo2k3k4k interface (specific to Tektronix).

Doctest and unittest are like 2 extremes of testing your python
code. One is simple and intuitive and the other is powerful and
requires more formality. In Python 2.4, doctest, builds in some of the
power of unittest, perhaps bridging the gap between the two. This
example shows you how to use doctest and the doctest.DocFileSuite
feature.

A simple DEMO to show how to enhance Python inside a Terminal. This works on Classic AMIGAs, E-UAE,
Debian Linux 6.0.0, PCLinuxOS 2009, Windows XP and Vista and WinUAE, from Python 1.4.0 to 3.3A2.

Due to a complaint about my _fun_ upload recently I decided to post this so that the MANY can now
find out how to manipulate text inside a Python Terminal window so that it looks much better.

Read the code for more information...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

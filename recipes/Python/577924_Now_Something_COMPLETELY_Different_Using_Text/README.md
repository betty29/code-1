Hi experts...

A kids level project to do for yourselves...

This is a Python DEMO to show the power of the sound card using Linux for
a specific usage that I need(ed). It is a kids level project that uses the
sound card as a variable DC Voltage reference for projects like stabilised
linear PSUs. Why linear? Relatively clean RF wise...

The TEST circuit is inside the code and is SOOO simple a dexterous 10 year
old could make it in less than an hour and have it up and running to start
using...

My own circuit is just as simple, isolated, and, gives me MUCH more voltage
range than the one inside the code... How did I do it? ;o)

This is for Python 2.x.x, (probably even down to 1.5.2) but it would be
just as easy to make it work on 3.x.x.
I'll let the big guns do that...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often VERY difficult problems...

Be aware of word wrapping etc...

Bazza,  G0LCU...

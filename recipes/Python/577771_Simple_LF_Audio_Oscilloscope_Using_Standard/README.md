A Linux DEMO to show how to display a waveform using standard text mode Python.
The audio device /dev/dsp is used and must be available. Levels are set using the
standard audio mixers.

Just feed a signal of say 300Hz to 3KHz, (normal voice spectrum), using say, the
internal mic, and watch the waveform appear inside the X-Y graticule.

This method WILL be used for a program proper and may be uploaded to this site
in the future.

Read the code for more information.

This code is Public Domain and you may do with it as you please.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.

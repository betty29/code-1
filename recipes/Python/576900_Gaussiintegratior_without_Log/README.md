The Gaussian quadrature is among the most accurate integration scheme for smooth integrands. It replaces a integral by a sum of sampled values of the integrand function times some weight factors.

This is strictly a minor rewrite of recipe 52292, just to make it compatible with Python 2.4 and above. 2to3 converts it perfectly to be used with Python 3.x

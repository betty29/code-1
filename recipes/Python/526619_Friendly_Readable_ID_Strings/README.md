One often needs unique ID strings to tag processes, threads, files or anything else that might be created in quantity. Traditionally these are created based on PIDs or similar system values. But it is not easy to visually recognise these strings, which makes debugging more difficult than it need be. This recipe creates readable and pronounceable ID strings that are much easier to work with.

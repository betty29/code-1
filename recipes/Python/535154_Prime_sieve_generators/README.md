Two simple generators for generating prime numbers using a prime sieve. gen_sieve(n) will produce all prime numbers <n, and gen_infsieve() will infinitely produce prime numbers.

isprime is an example of how one could use gen_sieve: a quick function for testing primality by attempting modulo division with each potential prime factor of a number.

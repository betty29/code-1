Decorates a class so that it encounters a breakpoint for any call to class.method_name(self,*args,**kwargs), where
- method_name is given by string
- only if arguments meet a test: arg_test(self,*args,**kwargs) -> bool [default -> True]

Behaviour easily changed for other actions than breakpoint (logging,...)

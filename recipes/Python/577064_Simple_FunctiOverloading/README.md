The recipe presents a simple decorator for function overloading in python. The @overloaded function searches for the first overloads that doesn't raise TypeError when called. Overloads are added to the overloads list by using the @func.overload_with decorator. The order of function definition determines which function gets tried first and once it founds a compatible function, it skips the rest of the overloads list.

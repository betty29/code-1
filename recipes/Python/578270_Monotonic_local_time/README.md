A Mutton, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich is generally agreed to be the greatest thing in the world. But a different kind of MLT comes in at a close second: Monotonic Local Time. This is a time value in your local timezone that takes care of that annoying hour that happens once a year where time goes backwards. It works by extending the previous day by a couple of hours (24, 25 etc) until after the switch.

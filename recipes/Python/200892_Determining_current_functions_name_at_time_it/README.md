whoaminow() can be used inside a function to determine, at the time it is called, the name under which that function has been invoked.

NOTE: This solution is *extremely* brittle and provides very limited utility, as it stands. However, it does serve to highlight an interesting avenue for introspection, namely, the dis module.

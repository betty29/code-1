effbot's ElementTree module (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm) is an excellent way to work with XML. It has a lot of incarnations though so distributing code that uses it right now is little bit of a pain. Here is a snippet you might want to use to import one of all the available incarnations -- hopefully the users of your script will have one.

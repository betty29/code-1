You have some single-toplevel Tkinter apps that you want to organize in a notebook-like fashion, associating each tab to an app, in a way which requires minimal changes in your original apps. This simple notebook class allows that, also supporting different tab orientations (TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT & RIGHT).

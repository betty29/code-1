Explore the mysteries of floating point arithmetic.  This class readily reproduces textbook examples and provides immediate demonstrations of representation error, loss of precision (subtractive cancellation), and the failure of the distributive, commutative, and associative laws.  Beyond textbook work, this class is also useful for exploring the numerical robustness of alternative algorithms.

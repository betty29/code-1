A very-very simple dice game:
two persons("You" and "CPU") are dropping dices.
If someone scores 17 during dropping dices, he wins.
Any doubts are interpreted to a humans` side.
(i`m too lasy to add draw here)
And one more. Rules say- "if someone drops 3 same dices at the beginning, he wins."
this is not realized in game, too. (but the probability of this is just about 1.4%)

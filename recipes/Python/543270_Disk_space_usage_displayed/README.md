Displays the disk space used by all the files/directories under the given directories. The depth to which the directories are displayed can be specified. There are three different options to select which files/directories are displayed - top N, cumulative percent contribution, individual percent contribution. The user can also control whether files should be shown along with directories. For each entry, in addition to its disk space, the percentage of the disk space of the parent directory that the entry consumes is also shown.

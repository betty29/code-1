This recipe can separate the output of PyChecker, PyFlakes, PyCodeStyle (formerly Pep8) and/or McCabe into OK'd and regular warning messages.

If invoked from Python 3+, this recipe with run Flake8 by default.  Command line option -3 allows running Python 3+ versions of the checkers.  

An example is included further below.  See the module documentation or -help for more details, versions, etc.

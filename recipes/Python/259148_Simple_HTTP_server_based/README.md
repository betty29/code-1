A simple HTTP Server, intended to be as simple as the standard module SimpleHTTPServer, built upon the asyncore/asynchat modules (uses non-blocking sockets). Provides a Server (copied from medusa http_server) and a RequestHandler class. RequestHandler handles both GET and POST methods and inherits SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

It can be easily extended by overriding the handle_data() method in the RequestHandler class

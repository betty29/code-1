Note: This recipe is superceded by TestOOB, a Python unit testing framework that extends unittest and provides many new features - including running tests in threads! http://testoob.sourceforge.net

Trying to extend unittest to provide extra features wasn't easy.
This scheme allows easy extensions for running existing test suites.

Extract all the text of a PDF (or other supported container types) at very high speed.
In general, text pieces of a PDF page are not arranged in natural reading order, but in the order they were entered during PDF creation.
This script re-arranges text blocks according to their pixel coordinates to achieve a more readable output, i.e. top-down, left-right.

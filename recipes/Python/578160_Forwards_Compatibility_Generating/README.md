This code auto-generates a function that converts a string to bytes only in Python Versions 3.x.x.
The function will NOT be generated in Python Versions 1.4.0 to 2.7.x. See the code for all the versions
tested on. Inside the code are commented-out lines to show a practical usage for this and WILL be used
in future /dev/audio or /dev/dsp access that I may develop...

See the notes right at the bottom and read all the notes inside the code...

This is NOT Public Domain like all my other stuff but is MIT licenced...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

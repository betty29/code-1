Basemap is a toolkit of matplotlib used to plot geographic maps.

With this function you can:

* Draw the latitude/longitude grid easily in one line of code, specifying the lat/lon intervals.

* Use rcParams, so all your figures will look more consistent.

* Specify the label pad *in points* (instead of projection units).

* Place the labels indicating which margins will be used.

This is not for the big guns, but for the Amateur coder AND radio enthusiast.

It is a DEMO Morse Code Practice Oscillator that will allow the user to practice
sending Morse code using the "o" and "p" keys as a PSEUDO-paddle key. It is set to
around 8 WPM, (Words Per Minute). The code allows "O" and "P" to be used at around
12 WPM, when "Caps Lock" is turned on. Read the code for more informtion.

It is for at least standard text mode Python 2.5.2 to 2.7.2 using PCLinuxOS 2009 and
Debian 6.0.0. It may well work at a much earlier version. I do have a version for
Python 3.x.x but that will be uploaded elsewhere.

It is written in such a way that youngsters can understand what is going on.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

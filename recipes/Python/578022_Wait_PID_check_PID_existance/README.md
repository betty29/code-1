Two functions: one which waits for a certain PID to terminate (with optional timeout), another one which checks whether a process with a given PID is running.

This was extracted from [psutil](http://code.google.com/p/psutil/) project which also provides a Windows implementation.

Timeout functionality is implemented as a busy loop and it was inspired by http://bugs.python.org/issue5673.

I created this class and related functions because I like accessing database results by field name rather than field number.  Accessing by field number has many problems: code is less readable, code gets broken when field positions change or fields are added or deleted from the query, etc.

This class should have little overhead if you are already using fetchall().
It wraps each result row in a ResultRow class which allows you to retrieve results via a dictionary interface (by column name).  The regular list interface (by column number) is also provided.

I can't believe the DB-API 2.0 api didn't include dictionary-style results. I'd love to see the reasoning behind not requiring them of database connection classes.

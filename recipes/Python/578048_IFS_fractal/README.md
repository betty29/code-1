I found this equation in Wikipedia page for "List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension".
The problem is how to calculate the scaling coefficients for any given IFS fractal.
You can see the heuristic I used in the code.
It gave correct values for all the fractals listed except for Centipede it gave 2.27.  
I do not know its correct fractal dimension to compare though.

An example done to solve this problem:

http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/101.html

Animation by vpython (visual python): http://vpython.org/

Provides some 3d coolness for new pythonists. Shows some stack usage. Probably should be shorter.

In the __main__ statement at the bottom, replace test2() with parse(), then type something like this on each line:
10
move 5 onto 1
pile 1 onto 3
move 6 over 2
pile 3 over 2
etc.

See the problem link at the top for full instructions...

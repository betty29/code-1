Monty_Hall is a gameshow host that proves that it is statistically better to switch when offered the chance after getting additional knowledge in a fair game.  The caveat is "statistically better", which means any single trial can have unsupporting results. But "statistically better" is exactly where the fist-fights at bars and family reunions start, so no matter the single trial outcomes.

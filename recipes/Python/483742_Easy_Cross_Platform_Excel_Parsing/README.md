Easily extract data from microsoft excel files using this wrapper class for xlrd (http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm).  The class allows you to create a generator which returns excel data one row at a time as either a list or dictionary.  I found this very handy for easily pulling in a variety of excel files without having to deal with COM calls or even needing to have windows.

This recipe was originally posted by `sjvr767` on http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25565 and I decided to also make it available here.

It uses pypdf (http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/)

The script is supposed to be run like this:

   `pdf_crop.py"  -m "120 50 120 180"  -i mypdf.pdf`

where the margins are `left top right bottom`

To install pyPdf try `easy_install pypdf`.

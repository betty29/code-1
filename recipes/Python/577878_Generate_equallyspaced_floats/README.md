Generating a list of equally-spaced floats can surprising due to floating point rounding. See, for example, the recipe for a [floating point range](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577068). One way of avoiding some surprises is by changing the API: instead of specifying a start, stop and step values, instead use a start, stop and count:

    >>> list(spread(0.0, 2.1, 7))
    [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]

Like [frange](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577068) `spread` takes an optional mode argument to select whether the start and end values are included. By default, start is included and end is not, and exactly count values are returned.

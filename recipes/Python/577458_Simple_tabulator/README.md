This is a simple script to covert a top to bottom list of items into a left to right list.

     a 
     b 
     c
     d
     e
     f
     g
     h
     i
     j
     k
     l
     m

into

     a  b  c  d  e  f  g
     h  i  j  k  l  m


A few command line options allow some amount of customisation.

A helper class and function to make it easy to configure logging, and an example of using it to send `INFO` to `sys.stdout` and `WARNING` or above to `sys.stderr`.

This is a simple port to Python 2 (I tested on 2.7) of [Nick Coghlan's Python 3 recipe](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577496-simple-creation-configuration-and-installation-of-/) for doing the same thing.

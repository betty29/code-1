It's a simple recipe to convert a str type string with pure unicode code point (e.g string = **"\u5982\u679c\u7231"** ) to an unicode type string. 
Actually, this method has the same effect with **'u'** prefix. But differently, it allows you to pass a variable of code points string as well as a constant one.

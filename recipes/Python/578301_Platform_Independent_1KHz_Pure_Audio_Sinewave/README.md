A mono _pure_ sinewave generator using standard text mode Python 2.6.7 to at least 2.7.3.

This DEMO kids level 1KHz generator is mainly for a MacBook Pro, (13 inch in my case),
OSX 10.7.5 and above. See below...

It is another simple piece of testgear for the young amateur electronics enthusiast and
uses pyaudio fully installed for it to work.

PyAudio can be obtained from here:- http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

This was primarily for a MacBook Pro, but works on at least 2 Linux flavours and Windows Vista 32 bit...

The sinewave generated is near excellent...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... Bazza, G0LCU...

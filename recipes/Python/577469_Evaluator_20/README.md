This is a complete rewrite of recipe 576790. While aiming to maintain similar functionality and continuing its implementation for self-academic purposes, a much cleaner parser / tokenizer and operator execution engine were developed. A slightly different math syntax is supported in this version, but it is arguably better and more capable than it previously was. Base prefixes are a feature now supported, and the single downgrade is calculating with integers instead of floats.

This is a(n) LED style "VU" meter in the vertical plane instead of the horizontal one in the recipe below:-

It is another "AT A GLANCE" display with an overload error beep too.

This is for Linux only and tested on Python 2.6.x although it should work on earlier 2.x.x versions.

A Python 3.x.x version can be found here:-

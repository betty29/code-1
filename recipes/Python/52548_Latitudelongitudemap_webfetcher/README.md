Given a list of cities, this recipe fetches their latitudes and longitudes from
one website (a database used for astrology, of all things) and uses them to
build a URL for another website which creates a map highlighting the cities
against the outlines of continents. Maybe some day it will be clever enough to
load the latitudes and longitudes as waypoints into your GPS receiver.

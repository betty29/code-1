This program is an mutated version of Bouncing Balls
Demonstration. Bombs fall to the floor, but if they
touch each other, they explode with velocity and are
quickly repelled away from each other. All bombs are
identified with numbers and can be clicked to change
colors. If you wish to follow individual bombs, you
may wish to note their numbers. Otherwise, you may
also change their colors in an attempt to keep track
of them.

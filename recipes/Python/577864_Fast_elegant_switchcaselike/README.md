My approach to that common issue focuses on **efficiency** and **elegant, declarative style** of definition. That's why:

* The way switches work is based on unwrapped defaultdict/list lookup.
* The way you define switches is based on classes and easy-to-use decorators (note that you can use subclassing in a flexible way -- without any negative impact on efficiency!).
* Its use cases focus on a-lot-of-keys situations and it does not cover the *fall-through* feature (though you can reach its semantics if you really need that -- by calling class methods...).

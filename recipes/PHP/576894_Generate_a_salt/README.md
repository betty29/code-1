This function will generate a salt for use with passwords ranging using characters in range a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and !@#$%&*?. The characters are sorted in a random value and can appear more than one time in the string. This way, this function is more powerful than the *shuffle()* function. This means that the salt could also be longer than the character list.

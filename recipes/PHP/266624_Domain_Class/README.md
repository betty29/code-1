This class returns the whois information an checks the availability of at least 270 different top level domains.

Also it validates the domains name (Thought have been given to the new IDN special chars). CNO WHOIS informations where returned completely.

========= !!! Attention begin !!! =========

If you want to check the new IDN domain names please use the IDN Convert class by Matthias Sommerfeld (http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1509.html).

First translate the domain and the check it normally with the domain class.

Here's a quick and dirty rendering of the Dragon Curve or Paper Folding fractal. What happens if you repeatedly fold a piece of paper in half numerous times then unfold it once 90 degrees, then again 90 degrees and so on. You get a fractal curve which has several interesting properties. For example, you can combine 4 of these curves and not only will they not overlap but they fill the plane.

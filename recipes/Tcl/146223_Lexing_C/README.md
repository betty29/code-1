Lexing C sources into a list of tokens. Demonstration of the string processing facilities of Tcl. The same approach will work for essentially all keyword based languages, for example Pascal, module, Eiffel, etc.
<p>
List and quoting based languages (Tcl itself, Lisp, ...) can be done too, but this is not optimal.

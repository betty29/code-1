This script validates XML files while recursively traversing a specified directory tree.  It requires three packages fileutil, tnc and tdom.  Tnc and tdom are not part of the standard Tcl distro.

Tdom is available from http://www.tdom.org/
Tdom tutorial is available from http://mini.net/tcl/1948

Tnc is included with tdom zip file.
Tnc info at http://mini.net/tcl/4577 and http://www.tdom.org/tnc.html.

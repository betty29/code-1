Add multiple language real time translating ability to a Tcl/Tk application in only about 100 lines of code. I'm a doctor and I'm using it in a medical application where I need to communicate in real time with Spanish and Portuguese speaking patients and their families. Add text to speech with ViaVoice or Festival speech synthesis tools.

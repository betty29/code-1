Have you a wish to launch VBScript without temporary files and right from batch? Maybe you think that it's not possible, but you think wrong. Do you remember my [post](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578315-create-cab-or-zip-with-batch/?in=lang-batch) for executing JScript from batch? So, maybe you are familiar with 'MSScriptControl' object which helps to execute JScript code in VBScripts or conversely - VBScript code inside JScripts. Let's take a look.

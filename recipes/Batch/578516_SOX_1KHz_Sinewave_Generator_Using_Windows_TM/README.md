32 bit Windows to Windows 7...

This batch file generates a 65536 byte binary file to give 8 seconds of pure sinewave at the earphone/speaker output(s)...

It uses ONLY a default Windows 32 bit installation, to Windows 7, except for the installation of SOX...

Obtain SOX from here:-

http://sox.sourceforge.net/

Notepad was the _main_ editor... ;o)

Hopefully the code section does NOT corrupt the binary part which is 8 bytes in size.
If it does then let me know on here and I will post a pointer from where to grab it...

Enjoy...

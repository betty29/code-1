Quick search on files index embedded directly in the command script. For example: "search.cmd exe$" - looks for all EXE files in index or just "search.cmd blahblahblah" - looks for all matches with "blahblahblah" in paths. To remove index from script use "search.cmd /fix:me" command (without quotes).

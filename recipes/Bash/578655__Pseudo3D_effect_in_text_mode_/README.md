This is just a simple DEMO to display a pseudo-3D effect using a bash script.
It generates a recessed box and a button and writes some thext inside bot.

There are two pieces of code, one for Linux, and one for OSX 10.7.5...

The Linux version also works on OSX 10.7.5 but is harder to see so a near
identical version using the default OSX terminal colours was craeted instead.

You will have to split the two code pieces up yourself to run...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

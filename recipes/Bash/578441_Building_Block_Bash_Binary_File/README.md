Apologies for any typos, and IF this has been done before...

The code generates a 256 byte binary file of _characters_ 0x00 to 0xFF for general usage and generates another binary file manipulated in a basic way.

The for loops in the code are purely for DEMO purposes only.

This is Public Domain and you may do with it as you please. I have uploaded it elsewhere too...

Watch for wordwrapping, etc and read the code for more information...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

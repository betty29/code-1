Very simple way to get external IP and geolocation uysing dig and geoiplookup.

`dig` is cool to obtain my external IP and I use `geoiplookup` to convert IP to location. You need geoip-bin and, geoip-database (and/or geoip-database-contrib and geoip-database-extra). In Debian, database seems update monthly.

It's just a tip.

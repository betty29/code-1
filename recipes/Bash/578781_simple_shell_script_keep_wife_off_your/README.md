How many times have you been asked to remember to do something from the other half whilst she is out for a short while.

For example: "You WILL check the dinner every few minutes won't you?"

And how many times did/do you forget?

Most of us have been there...

This is a simple kids level, practical learning, shell script that generates an "xterm" with your reminder inside every 30 seconds for a period of 3 seconds.

It is always be the active front window for 3 seconds at a time to _annoy_ you into remembering.

Usage: reminder "What you have to remember here using spaces AND double quotes."<CR>

Just reanme the downloaded script to reminder and remember to chmod it as required.

Just run it from your default terminal and when finished press Ctrl-C just AFTER the xterm window closes.

There is NO error detection so steer clear of any special characters in you reminder text.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

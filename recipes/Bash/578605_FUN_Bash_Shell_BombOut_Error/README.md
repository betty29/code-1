Do you remember the Bomb-Out icon(s) that appeared on some computers' SW and HW many years ago...

Well this is a matching sound to go with it and can be used as a critical error sound.

It sounds like a bomb being dropped from an aeroplane and is purely a shell sript only.

It is set up to run SOund eXchange, SOX, but just by editing the code "/dev/dsp" can be used instead.

Read the code for more informastion.

Enjoy...

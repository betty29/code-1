This is probably common knowledge to the professionals but not so much for amateurs like myself.

This is a code snippet for the equivalent of BASIC's...

LET char$=INKEY$

As the timeout parameter cannot be less than 1 second then this is the only limitation...

It is a single line function which has a variable "char"...

Read the code for more information...

There are now two versions, edit out and choose which is best for you...

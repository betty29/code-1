A very simple crude sinewave generator using a BASH script inside a Linux Terminal.

The file required is generated inside the code and requires /dev/audio to work.

Ensure you have this device, if not the download oss-compat from your OS's repository...

It lasts for about 8 seconds before exiting and saves a 65536 byte file to your working directory/drawer/folder as sinewave.raw.

Use an oscilloscope to check the waveform generated...

It is entirely Public Domain and you may do with it as you please...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)

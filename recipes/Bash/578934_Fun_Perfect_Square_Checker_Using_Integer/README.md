A recent Python upload here gave me the inspiration to do a bash version...
This is a little tongue-in-cheek but an enjoyable bit of fun.

It took around 11 seconds to prove 90000000000 had a perfect square of 300000...

It is a stand alone program and has a degree of INPUT error correction...

It was done on a MacBook Pro, OSX 10.7.5, default bash terminal and should work on Linux flavours but it is untested...

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...

Bazza...

Save this to "nicerest", `chmod +x`-it, and pipe your REST API `curl` calls through this for nicer output. It will notice HTTP headers (curl's `-i` option) and skips those before attempting to pretty-print the following JSON.


Note: This is currently using node 0.2. I should update for 0.3 changes (I think `process.openStdin` changed).

Gets the Find Results Manager for the "Find Results 1" tab, if it exists.
If the tab has rows in it, then copies out all the data from each row and adds it to an output buffer.
Creates a new editor view (or optionally reuses the existing one) and appends the output buffer to it.
Note: Be sure to see Bruno's update below, until I get it merged in. ;)

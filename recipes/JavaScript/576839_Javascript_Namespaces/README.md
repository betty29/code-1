This recipe enables you to modularize javascript libraries by placing all library code within a namespace object.  All namespaces are rooted at "window.global_namespace".  References between namespaces are supported by the Import function, which allows forward references to namespaces that have yet to be defined.

See code comment for more detailed examples.

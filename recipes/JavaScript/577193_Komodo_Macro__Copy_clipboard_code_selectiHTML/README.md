This macro makes easy to paste on documents (MS Office, Open Office, iWorks Pages) code snippets with syntax highlight and/or line numbers.

This macro copies the selected code text or whole document if no selection is present on clipboard in HTML format.

On OSX you need at least Komodo 6 because previous versions don't support data flavors

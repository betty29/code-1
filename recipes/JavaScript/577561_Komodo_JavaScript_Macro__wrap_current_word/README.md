A [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo) JavaScript macro that can be used to wrap the current word under the cursor position (or current selection) with arbitrary text.

For example, if I'm editing a HTML file and have the selected text "This is my heading", I can quickly use this macro to wrap this text into "<h1>This is my heading</h1>".

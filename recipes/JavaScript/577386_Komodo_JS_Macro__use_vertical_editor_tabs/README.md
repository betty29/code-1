A [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide) JavaScript macro that can be used to position the editor tabs on the right side and shown vertically.

Additional layouts (left, right, up, down, vertical, horizontal) can be made with different combinations, see here for the Mozilla tabbox positioning documentation:

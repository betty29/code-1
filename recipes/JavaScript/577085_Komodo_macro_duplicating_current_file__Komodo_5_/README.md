Komodo projects look like file managers, but don't always offer the same functionality directly.
Here's a macro that makes a copy of the current selected file in a project.  To use it,
create a new macro in the Komodo toolbox, copy this code, paste it in the macro, and save it.
Then you can select a file, double-click the macro icon (or assign it to a keybinding),
and Komodo will create a copy of the file called "Copy of <basename>.<extension>".

When your cursor is at the end of an indented blank line, and you press the enter key, this macro will catch that keypress and insert an empty new line above the current line. This pushes your indented line down, and you can keep coding as normal. It is quite seamless; the only difference is that you have not left any whitespace in your wake.

This makes it easier to follow the Python PEP-8 style guide, but it's not limited to Python code.

When editing a group of similar lines, it's very convenient to be able to press down-arrow
and move to the same starting column position on the next line.  (See an example at
http://community.activestate.com/forum/vertical-editing ).

This code is for a Komodo 6 macro -- possibly the only tweak necessary to make it work on Komodo 5 is by commenting out the "macro.save()" code, but I haven't tested it.  The discussion below will talk about how to use it.

Ingredients
Artisan Mix - Butter lettuce, Baby Fris√©e(endive), lollo rosso(ruffled red lettuce), Arugula
             ..now this is the variety I like to use, but any commercial spring mix will be suffice.
Dried Cranberries - Craisins or other variety

Pistachios - I prefer unsalted, shelled. 

Unripened goat`s cheese - The difference between ripened and unripened is ripened has a rind to it. I encourage you to try both.

Lemon-Thyme Dressing

1/2 cup lemon juice
1 1/2 cups Classic Olive Oil
1/4 cup sugar
1 bunch of fresh thyme

Add lemon juice, sugar, thmye to blender slowly add oil to emulsify
The quality of emulsing will determine how long it takes to seperate

Wash lettuce and cut. Throw a handful of cranberries, and pistachios. Crumble goats cheese, dress and serve

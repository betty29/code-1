Html web page to preview latex equations rendered by mathjax. [demo here](http://jsfiddle.net/r82p49xx/5/)

Equations are updated when shift, space or enter keys are pressed, or when the Textarea lose focus.

In the first block you can try inline-style math, in the second one, display-style math.
